Per MacKay’s note below excluding cartoons and photos with a named photographer, the first version of this doesn’t include any images, only .html files. A good step would be sorting through everything to figure out what images are covered under the CC license.

About the "free book" license

This is a free book. I didn't write this book to make money. I wrote it because sustainable energy is important. If you would like to have the book for free for your own use, please help yourself to any of the electronic versions on this website. There's pdf and html versions (thanks to William Sigmund!); we are working on other formats.

This is a free book in a second sense: you are free to use all the material in this book, except for the cartoons and the photos with a named photographer, under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike 2.0 UK: England & Wales Licence. (The cartoons and photos are excepted because the authors have generally given me permission only to include their work, not to share it under a Creative Commons license.) You are especially welcome to use my materials for educational purposes. This website includes links to separate high-quality files for each of the figures in the book.

A note to pirates, this license does not allow you or anyone to print and sell the book on amazon marketplace! [Further information about pirates, & photographs]

In response to generous readers...

If you enjoy the free electronic copy of the book and would like to make a financial donation, without buying the paper book for yourself, please may I suggest that you find a library or a school that would like a paper copy of the book, and buy it for them? Thank you!

Many thanks to William Sigmund and openDemocracy for the HTML conversion! http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/economics/energy-without-hot-air-group-read
