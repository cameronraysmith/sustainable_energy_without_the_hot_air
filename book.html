This crisis is comingsoon, he predicts: the crisis will bite, not when the last drop of oil isextracted, but when oil extraction can&#8217;t meet demand &#8211; perhaps as soonas 2015 or 2025. Moreover, even if we magically switched all our energy-guzzling to nuclear power right away, Goodstein says, the oil crisis wouldsimply be replaced by a <em> nuclear</em> crisis in just twenty years or so, as uraniumreserves also became depleted.</p><p>In <em> The Skeptical Environmentalist</em>, Bj&#248;rn Lomborg paints a completelydifferent picture. &#8220;Everything is &#64257;ne.&#8221; Indeed, &#8220;everything is getting bet-ter.&#8221; Furthermore, &#8220;we are not headed for a major energy crisis,&#8221; and&#8220;there is plenty of energy.&#8221;</p><p>How could two smart people come to such different conclusions? I hadto get to the bottom of this.</p><p>Energy made it into the British news in 2006. Kindled by tidings ofgreat climate change and a tripling in the price of natural gas in just sixyears, the &#64258;ames of debate are raging. How should Britain handle itsenergy needs? And how should the world?</p><p>&#8220;Wind or nuclear?&#8221;, for example. Greater polarization of views amongsmart people is hard to imagine. During a discussion of the proposed ex-pansion of nuclear power, Michael Meacher, former environment minister,said &#8220;if we&#8217;re going to cut greenhouse gases by 60% ... by 2050 there is noother possible way of doing that except through renewables;&#8221; Sir BernardIngham, former civil servant, speaking in favour of nuclear expansion, said&#8220;anybody who is relying upon renewables to &#64257;ll the [energy] gap is livingin an utter dream world and is, in my view, an enemy of the people.&#8221;</p><p>Similar disagreement can be heard within the ecological movement.All agree that <em> something</em> must be done urgently, but <em> what?</em> Jonathon Por-ritt, chair of the Sustainable Development Commission, writes: &#8220;there isno justi&#64257;cation for bringing forward plans for a new nuclear power pro-gramme at this time, and ... any such proposal would be incompatiblewith [the Government&#8217;s] sustainable development strategy;&#8221; and &#8220;a non-nuclear strategy could and should be suf&#64257;cient to deliver all the carbonsavings we shall need up to 2050 and beyond, and to ensure secure accessto reliable sources of energy.&#8221; In contrast, environmentalist James Lovelockwrites in his book, <em>The Revenge of Gaia</em>: &#8220;Now is much too late to establishsustainable development.&#8221; In his view, power from nuclear &#64257;ssion, while</p><div class="imgcap"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="OutOfGasS.jpg" width="140" height="224"  alt="OutOfGas"><div class="sidebarcaption">David Goodstein&#8217;s <em>Out of Gas</em> (2004).</div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:21.43em"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="lomborgSES.jpg" width="140" height="199"  alt="SkepticalEnvironmentalist"><div class="sidebarcaption">Bj&#248;rn Lomborg&#8217;s <em> The Skeptical Environmentalist</em> (2001).</div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:40.71em;"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="revengeOfGaiaS.jpg" width="132" height="200"  alt="RevengeOfGaia"><div class="sidebarcaption" ><em>The Revenge of Gaia: Why the earth is &#64257;ghting back &#8211; and how we can still save humanity.</em> James Lovelock (2006). &#169; Allen Lane.</div></div></div> <div id="book_sidebar"><div class="pos" id="rm"></div></div><div id="textcol"><p class="first">not recommended as the long-term panacea for our ailing planet, is &#8220;theonly effective medicine we have now.&#8221; Onshore wind turbines are &#8220;merely ... a gesture to prove [our leaders&#8217;] environmental credentials.&#8221;</p><p>This heated debate is fundamentally about numbers. How much en-ergy could each source deliver, at what economic and social cost, and withwhat risks? But actual numbers are rarely mentioned. In public debates,people just say &#8220;Nuclear is a money pit&#8221; or &#8220;We have a <em> huge</em> amount ofwave and wind.&#8221; The trouble with this sort of language is that it&#8217;s notsuf&#64257;cient to know that something is huge: we need to know how the one&#8220;huge&#8221; compares with another &#8220;huge,&#8221; namely <em> our huge energy consump-</em><em>tion</em>. To  make  this  comparison,  we  need  numbers,  not  adjectives.</p><p>Where numbers are used, their meaning is often obfuscated by enor-mousness. Numbers are chosen to impress, to score points in arguments,rather than to inform. &#8220;Los Angeles residents drive 142 million miles &#8211; thedistance from Earth to Mars &#8211; every single day.&#8221; &#8220;Each year, 27 millionacres of tropical rainforest are destroyed.&#8221; &#8220;14 billion pounds of trash aredumped into the sea every year.&#8221; &#8220;British people throw away 2.6 billionslices of bread per year.&#8221; &#8220;The waste paper buried each year in the UKcould &#64257;ll 103448 double-decker buses.&#8221;</p><p>If all the ineffective ideas for solving the energy crisis were laid end toend, they would reach to the moon and back.... I digress.</p><p>The result of this lack of meaningful numbers and facts? We are inun-dated with a &#64258;ood of crazy innumerate codswallop. The BBC doles outadvice on how we can do our bit to save the planet &#8211; for example &#8220;switchoff your mobile phone charger when it&#8217;s not in use;&#8221; if anyone objects thatmobile phone chargers are not <em> actually</em> our number one form of energyconsumption, the mantra &#8220;every little helps&#8221; is wheeled out. Every littlehelps? A more realistic mantra is:</p><blockquote>if everyone does a little, we&#8217;ll achieve only a little.</blockquote><p>Companies also contribute to the daily codswallop as they tell us howwonderful they are, or how they can help us &#8220;do our bit.&#8221; BP&#8217;s website, forexample, celebrates the reductions in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) pollution theyhope to achieve by changing the paint used for painting BP&#8217;s ships.

It seems possible that cheap oil(on which our cars and lorries run) and cheap gas (with which we heatmany of our buildings) will run out in our lifetime. So we seek alternativeenergy sources. Indeed given that fossil fuels are a valuable resource, use-ful for manufacture of plastics and all sorts of other creative stuff, perhapswe should save them for better uses than simply setting &#64257;re to them.</p><p>Second, we&#8217;re interested in security of energy supply. Even if fossilfuels are still available somewhere in the world, perhaps we don&#8217;t want todepend on them if that would make our economy vulnerable to the whimsof untrustworthy foreigners. (I hope you can hear my tongue in my cheek.)Going by &#64257;gure 1.2, it certainly looks as if &#8220;our&#8221; fossil fuels have peaked.The UK has a particular security-of-supply problem looming, known as the&#8220;energy gap.&#8221; A substantial number of old coal power stations and nuclearpower stations will be closing down during the next decade (&#64257;gure 1.3),so there is a risk that electricity demand will sometimes exceed electricitysupply, if adequate plans are not implemented.</p><p>Third, it&#8217;s very probable that using fossil fuels changes the climate.Climate change is blamed on several human activities, but the biggest con-tributor to climate change is the increase in greenhouse effect produced bycarbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Most of the carbon dioxide emissions come fromfossil-fuel burning. And the main reason we burn fossil fuels is for energy.So to &#64257;x climate change, we need to sort out a new way of getting energy.The climate problem is mostly an energy problem.</p><p>Whichever of these three concerns motivates you, we need energy num-bers, and policies that add up.</p><p>The &#64257;rst two concerns are straightforward sel&#64257;sh motivations for dras-tically reducing fossil fuel use. The third concern, climate change, is a morealtruistic motivation &#8211; the brunt of climate change will be borne not by usbut by future generations over many hundreds of years. Some people feelthat climate change is not their responsibility. They say things like &#8220;What&#8217;sthe point in my doing anything? China&#8217;s out of control!&#8221; So I&#8217;m going todiscuss climate change a bit more now, because while writing this book Ilearned some interesting facts that shed light on these ethical questions. Ifyou have no interest in climate change, feel free to fast-forward to the nextsection on page 16.</p><h2>The climate-change motivation</h2><p class="first">The climate-change motivation is argued in three steps: one: human fossil-fuel burning causes carbon dioxide concentrations to rise; two: carbondioxide is a greenhouse gas; three: increasing the greenhouse effect in-creases average global temperatures (and has many other effects).</p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure4.png" width="218" height="204"  alt="North Sea Oil production"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.2</span> Are&#8220;our&#8221; fossil fuelsrunning out?

Does &#8220;scep-tic&#8221; mean &#8220;a person who has not even glanced at the data&#8221;? Don&#8217;t youthink, just possibly, <em>something</em> may have happened between 1800AD and2000AD?

While the &#64257;rst practical steam engine was invented in1698, Watt&#8217;s more ef&#64257;cient steam engine really got the Industrial Revolu-tion going. One of the steam engine&#8217;s main applications was the pumpingof water out of coal mines. Figure 1.5 shows what happened to Britishcoal production from 1769 onwards. The &#64257;gure displays coal productionin units of billions of tons of CO<sub>2</sub> released when the coal was burned.In 1800, coal was used to make iron, to make ships, to heat buildings,to power locomotives and other machinery, and of course to power thepumps that enabled still more coal to be scraped up from inside the hillsof England and Wales. Britain was terribly well endowed with coal: whenthe Revolution started, the amount of carbon sitting in coal under Britainwas roughly the same as the amount sitting in oil under Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In the 30 years from 1769 to 1800, Britain&#8217;s annual coal productiondoubled.

The log-arithmic graphs allow us to compare growth rates.

The point is that these<em>natural</em> &#64258;ows in and out of the atmosphere have been almost exactly inbalance for millenia. So it&#8217;s not relevant at all that these natural &#64258;ows arelarger than human emissions. The natural &#64258;ows <em>cancelled themselves out</em>.So the natural &#64258;ows, large though they were, left the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>in the atmosphere and ocean <em> constant</em>, over the last few thousand years.Burning fossil fuels, in contrast, creates a <em> new</em> &#64258;ow of carbon that, thoughsmall, is <em> not cancelled</em>.

This stream adds an extra <span class="red">50 passengers per hour</span> to thearrivals lobby &#8211; a small addition compared to the original arrival rate ofone thousand per hour. Initially at least, the authorities don&#8217;t increase thenumber of of&#64257;cials, and the of&#64257;cials carry on processing just one thousandpassengers per hour. So what happens? Slowly but surely, <em>the queue grows</em>.Burning fossil fuels is undeniably increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in theatmosphere and in the surface oceans. No climate scientist disputes thisfact. When it comes to CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, man <em> is</em> signi&#64257;cant.</p><p>OK. Fossil fuel burning increases CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations signi&#64257;cantly. Butdoes it matter? &#8220;Carbon is nature!&#8221;, the oilspinners remind us, &#8220;Carbon islife!&#8221; If CO<sub>2</sub> had no harmful effects, then indeed carbon emissions wouldnot matter. However, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Not the strongestgreenhouse gas, but a signi&#64257;cant one nonetheless. Put more of it in theatmosphere, and it does what greenhouse gases do: it absorbs infraredradiation (heat) heading out from the earth and reemits it in a random di-rection; the effect of this random redirection of the atmospheric heat traf&#64257;cis to impede the &#64258;ow of heat from the planet, just like a quilt. So carbondioxide has a warming effect. This fact is based not on complex historicalrecords of global temperatures but on the simple physical properties ofCO<sub>2</sub> molecules. Greenhouse gases are a quilt, and CO<sub>2</sub> is one layer of thequilt.</p><p>So, if humanity succeeds in doubling or tripling CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations(which is where we are certainly heading, under business as usual), whathappens? Here, there is a lot of uncertainty. Climate science is dif&#64257;cult.The climate is a complex, twitchy beast, and exactly how much warmingCO<sub>2</sub> -doubling would produce is uncertain. The consensus of the best cli-mate models seems to be that doubling the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would haveroughly the same effect as increasing the intensity of the sun by 2%, andwould bump up the global mean temperature by something like 3&deg;C. Thiswould be what historians call a Bad Thing. I won&#8217;t recite the whole litanyof probable drastic effects, as I am sure you&#8217;ve heard it before. The litanybegins &#8220;the Greenland icecap would gradually melt, and, over a period ofa few 100 years, sea-level would rise by about 7 metres.&#8221; The brunt of thelitany falls on future generations. Such temperatures have not been seenon earth for at least 100000 years, and it&#8217;s conceivable that the ecosystemwould be so signi&#64257;cantly altered that the earth would stop supplying someof the goods and services that we currently take for granted.</p></div> <div id="book_sidebar"><div class="pos" id="rm"></div></div><div id="textcol"><p>Climate modelling is dif&#64257;cult and is dogged by uncertainties. But un-certainty about exactly how the climate will respond to extra greenhousegases is no justi&#64257;cation for inaction. If you were riding a fast-moving mo-torcycle in fog near a cliff-edge, and you didn&#8217;t have a good map of thecliff, would the lack of a map justify <em> not</em> slowing the bike down?</p><p>So, who should slow the bike down? Who should clean up carbonemissions? Who is responsible for climate change? This is an ethical ques-tion, of course, not a scienti&#64257;c one, but ethical discussions must be foundedon facts. Let&#8217;s now explore the facts about greenhouse gas emissions. First,a word about the units in which they are measured. Greenhouse gasesinclude carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; each gas has dif-ferent physical properties; it&#8217;s conventional to express all gas emissionsin &#8220;equivalent amounts of carbon dioxide,&#8221; where &#8220;equivalent&#8221; means&#8220;having the same warming effect over a period of 100 years.&#8221; One tonof carbon-dioxide-equivalent may be abbreviated as &#8220;1 t CO<sub>2</sub>e,&#8221; and onebillion tons (one thousand million tons) as &#8220;1 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>e&#8221; (one gigaton). Inthis book 1 t means one metric ton (1000 kg). I&#8217;m not going to distinguishimperial tons, because they differ by less than 10% from the metric ton ortonne.</p><p>In the year 2000, the world&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions were about 34billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per year. An incomprehensible number.But we can render it more comprehensible and more personal by divid-ing by the number of people on the planet, 6 billion, so as to obtain thegreenhouse-gas pollution <em>per person</em>, which is about 5&frac12; tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per yearper person. We can thus represent the world emissions by a rectanglewhose width is the population (6 billion) and whose height is the per-capita emissions.</p><img style="margin-top:30px" src="figure9.png" width="708" height="186"   alt="Greenhouse gas pollution"></div> <div id="book_sidebar"><div class="pos" id="rm"></div></div><div id="textcol"><p>Now, all people are created equal, but we don&#8217;t all emit 5&frac12; tons of CO<sub>2</sub>per year.

Each rectangle&#8217;s area represents the greenhousegas emissions of one region. The width of the rectangle is the populationof the region, and the height is the average per-capita emissions in thatregion.</p><p>In the year 2000, Europe&#8217;s per-capita greenhouse gas emissions weretwice the world average; and North America&#8217;s were four times the worldaverage.</p><p>We can continue subdividing, splitting each of the regions into coun-tries.

What about China, that naughty &#8220;out of control&#8221;country? Yes, the area of China&#8217;s rectangle is about the same as the USA&#8217;s,but the fact is that their per-capita emissions are <em> below</em> the world average.India&#8217;s per-capita emissions are less than <em> half</em> the world average. Moreover,it&#8217;s worth bearing in mind that much of the industrial emissions of Chinaand India are associated with the manufacture of <em>stuff for rich countries.</em> </p><p>So, assuming that &#8220;something needs to be done&#8221; to reduce greenhousegas emissions, who has a special responsibility to do something?

If we accept the ethical idea that &#8220;the polluter should pay&#8221; thenwe should ask how big is each country&#8217;s historical footprint.

What do scientists reckon needs to be done,to avoid a risk of giving the earth a 2&deg;C temperature rise (2&deg;C being therise above which they predict lots of bad consequences)? The consensusis clear. We need to get off our fossil fuel habit, and we need to do sofast. Some countries, including Britain, have committed to at least a 60%reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, but it must be emphasizedthat 60% cuts, radical though they are, are unlikely to cut the mustard.

The sort of cuts we need to aim for are shown in &#64257;g-ure 1.8. This &#64257;gure shows two possibly-safe emissions scenarios presentedby Baer and Mastrandrea (2006) in a report from the Institute for Pub-lic Policy Research. The lower curve assumes that a decline in emissionsstarted in 2007, with total global emissions falling at roughly 5% per year.The upper curve assumes a brief delay in the start of the decline, and a 4%drop per year in global emissions. Both scenarios are believed to offer amodest chance of avoiding a 2&deg;C temperature rise above the pre-industriallevel. In the lower scenario, the chance that the temperature rise will <em>ex-</em><em>ceed</em> 2&deg;C is estimated to be 9&#8211;26%. In the upper scenario, the chance ofexceeding 2&deg;C is estimated to be 16&#8211;43%.

This is such a deep cut, I suggest the best way to thinkabout it is <em>no more fossil fuels.</em></p><p>One last thing about the climate-change motivation: while a range ofhuman activities cause greenhouse-gas emissions, the biggest cause by faris <strong>energy use</strong>. Some people justify not doing anything about their energyuse by excuses such as &#8220;methane from burping cows causes more warmingthan jet travel.&#8221; Yes, agricultural by-products contributed one eighth ofgreenhouse-gas emissions in the year 2000. But energy-use contributedthree quarters (&#64257;gure 1.9). The climate change problem is principally anenergy problem.</p><h2>Warnings to the reader</h2><p class="first">OK, enough about climate change. I&#8217;m going to assume we are motivatedto get off fossil fuels. Whatever your motivation, the aim of this bookis to help you &#64257;gure out the numbers and do the arithmetic so that youcan evaluate policies; and to lay a factual foundation so that you can see<em>which proposals add up</em>. I&#8217;m not claiming that the arithmetic and numbersin this book are new; the books I&#8217;ve mentioned by Goodstein, Lomborg,and Lovelock, for example, are full of interesting numbers and back-of-envelope calculations, and there are many other helpful sources on theinternet too (see the notes at the end of each chapter).</p><p>What I&#8217;m aiming to do in this book is to make these numbers simpleand memorable; to show you how you can &#64257;gure out the numbers foryourself; and to make the situation so clear that any thinking reader willbe able to draw striking conclusions. I don&#8217;t want to feed you my own con-clusions. Convictions are stronger if they are self-generated, rather thantaught. Understanding is a creative process. When you&#8217;ve read this bookI hope you&#8217;ll have reinforced the con&#64257;dence that you can &#64257;gure anythingout.</p><p>I&#8217;d like to emphasize that the calculations we will do are deliberatelyimprecise. Simpli&#64257;cation is a key to understanding. First, by rounding thenumbers, we can make them easier to remember. Second, rounded num-bers allow quick calculations. For example, in this book, the populationof the United Kingdom is 60 million, and the population of the world is6 billion. I&#8217;m perfectly capable of looking up more accurate &#64257;gures, butaccuracy would get in the way of &#64258;uent thought. For example, if we learnthat the world&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 were 34 billion tons ofCO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per year, then we can instantly note, without a calculator,that the average emissions per person are 5 or 6 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent perperson per year. This rough answer is not exact, but it&#8217;s accurate enough toinform interesting conversations. For instance, if you learn that a round-trip intercontinental &#64258;ight emits nearly two tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger,then knowing the average emissions yardstick (5-and-a-bit tons per yearper person) helps you realize that just one such plane-trip per year corre-</p><div class="imgcap" style="top:500px"><img src="LowEManS.jpg" width="184" height="200"  alt="Low carbon emission man - cartoon"><div style="text-align:center"><em>&#8220;Look &#8211; it&#8217;s Low Carbon EmissionMan&#8221;</em></div><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 1.10.</span> Reproduced by kindpermission of PRIVATE EYE / PeterDredge <span class="websitetitle">www.private-eye.co.uk</span>.</div></div></div> <div id="book_sidebar"><div class="pos" id="rm"></div></div><div id="textcol"><p class="first">sponds to over a third of the average person&#8217;s carbon emissions.</p><p>I like to base my calculations on everyday knowledge rather than ontrawling through impersonal national statistics. For example, if I wantto estimate the typical wind speeds in Cambridge, I ask &#8220;is my cyclingspeed usually faster than the wind?&#8221; The answer is yes. So I can deducethat the wind speed in Cambridge is only rarely faster than my typicalcycling speed of 20km/h. I back up these everyday estimates with otherpeoples&#8217; calculations and with of&#64257;cial statistics. (Please look for these ineach chapter&#8217;s end-notes.) This book isn&#8217;t intended to be a de&#64257;nitive storeof super-accurate numbers. Rather, it&#8217;s intended to illustrate how to useapproximate numbers as a part of constructive consensual conversations.</p><p>In the calculations, I&#8217;ll mainly use the United Kingdom and occasion-ally Europe, America, or the whole world, but you should &#64257;nd it easy toredo the calculations for whatever country or region you are interested in.</p><p>Let me close this chapter with a few more warnings to the reader.Not only will we make a habit of approximating the numbers we cal-culate; we&#8217;ll also neglect all sorts of details that investors, managers, andeconomists have to attend to, poor folks. If you&#8217;re trying to launch a re-newable technology, just a 5% increase in costs may make all the differencebetween success and failure, so in business every detail must be tracked.But 5% is too small for this book&#8217;s radar. This is a book about factors of2 and factors of 10. It&#8217;s about physical limits to sustainable energy, notcurrent economic feasibility. While economics is always changing, the fun-damental limits won&#8217;t ever go away. We need to understand these limits.</p><p>Debates about energy policy are often confusing and emotional becausepeople mix together <em> factual</em> assertions and <em> ethical</em> assertions.</p><p>Examples of <strong>factual assertions</strong> are &#8220;global fossil-fuel burning emits 34billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year;&#8221; and &#8220;if CO<sub>2</sub> concen-trations are doubled then average temperatures will increase by 1.5&#8211;5.8&deg;Cin the next 100 years;&#8221; and &#8220;a temperature rise of 2&deg;C would cause theGreenland ice cap to melt within 500 years;&#8221; and &#8220;the complete melting ofthe Greenland ice cap would cause a 7-metre sea-level rise.&#8221;</p><p>A factual assertion is either true or false; &#64257;guring out <em> which</em> may be dif-&#64257;cult; it is a scienti&#64257;c question. For example, the assertions I just gave areeither true or false. But we don&#8217;t know whether they are all true. Some ofthem are currently judged &#8220;very likely.&#8221; The dif&#64257;culty of deciding whichfactual assertions are true leads to debates in the scienti&#64257;c community. Butgiven suf&#64257;cient scienti&#64257;c experiment and discussion, the truth or falsity ofmost factual assertions can eventually be resolved, at least &#8220;beyond rea-sonable doubt.&#8221;</p><p>Examples of <strong>ethical assertions</strong> are &#8220;it&#8217;s wrong to exploit global re-sources in a way that imposes signi&#64257;cant costs on future generations;&#8221; and&#8220;polluting should not be free;&#8221; and &#8220;we should take steps to ensure thatit&#8217;s unlikely that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will double;&#8221; and &#8220;politicians shouldagree a cap on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions;&#8221; and &#8220;countries with the biggest CO<sub>2</sub> emis-</p></div> <div id="book_sidebar"><div class="pos" id="rm"></div></div><div id="textcol"><p class="first">sions over the last century have a duty to lead action on climate change;&#8221;and &#8220;it is fair to share CO<sub>2</sub> emission rights equally across the world&#8217;spopulation.&#8221; Such assertions are not &#8220;either true or false.&#8221; Whether weagree with them depends on our ethical judgment, on our values. Ethicalassertions may be incompatible with each other; for example, Tony Blair&#8217;sgovernment declared a radical policy on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: &#8220;the United King-dom should reduce its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 60% by 2050;&#8221; at the same timeGordon Brown, while Chancellor in that government, repeatedly urgedoil-producing countries to <em> increase</em> oil production.</p><p>This book is emphatically intended to be about facts, not ethics.

My quote is adaptedfrom Dominic Lawson&#8217;s column in the <em>Independent</em>, 8 June, 2007.It is not a verbatim quote: I edited his words to make them briefer but tookcare not to correct any of his errors. <em class="darkred">All three numbers he mentions are in-</em><em class="darkred">correct</em>. Here&#8217;s how he screwed up. First, he says &#8220;carbon dioxide&#8221; but givesnumbers for carbon: the burning of fossil fuels sends <em>26</em> gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>per year into the atmosphere (not 7 gigatonnes). A common mistake. Sec-ond, he claims that the oceans send 36000 gigatonnes of carbon per yearinto the atmosphere. This is a far worse error: 36000 gigatonnes is the <em>totalamount</em> of carbon in the ocean! The annual <em>&#64258;ow</em> is much smaller &#8211; about 90 gi-gatonnes of carbon per year (330 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y), according to standard diagramsof the carbon cycle [<span class="tinylink">l6y5g</span>] (I believe this 90 GtC/y is the estimated &#64258;owrate, were the atmosphere suddenly to have its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reducedto zero.) Similarly his &#8220;1900 gigatonne&#8221; &#64258;ow from biosphere to atmosphereis wrong. The correct &#64257;gure according to the standard diagrams is about 120gigatonnes of carbon per year (440 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>/y).</p><p>Incidentally, the observed rise in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is nicely in line with what you&#8217;d expect, assuming most of thehuman emissions of carbon remained in the atmosphere. From 1715 to 2004, roughly 1160 GtCO<sub>2</sub> have been releasedto the atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and cement production (Marland et al., 2007). If <em>all</em> of this CO<sub>2</sub>had stayed in the atmosphere, the concentration would have risen by 160ppm (from 280 to 440 ppm). The actual risehas been about 100ppm (from 275 to 377ppm). So roughly 60% of what was emitted is now in the atmosphere.</p><p><span class="mark">10</span><em class="darkred">Carbon dioxide has a warming effect</em>. The over-emotional debate about this topic is getting quite tiresome, isn&#8217;t it?&#8220;The science is now settled.&#8221; &#8220;No it isn&#8217;t!&#8221; &#8220;Yes it is!&#8221; I think the most helpful thing I can do here is direct anyonewho wants a break from the shouting to a brief report written by Charney et al. (1979). This report&#8217;s conclusionscarry weight because the National Academy of Sciences (the US equivalent of the Royal Society) commissioned thereport and selected its authors on the basis of their expertise, &#8220;and with regard for appropriate balance.&#8221; The studygroup was convened &#8220;under the auspices of the Climate Research Board of the National Research Council to assessthe scienti&#64257;c basis for projection of possible future climatic changes resulting from man-made releases of carbondioxide into the atmosphere.&#8221; Speci&#64257;cally, they were asked: &#8220;to identify the principal premises on which our currentunderstanding of the question is based, to assess quantitatively the adequacy and uncertainty of our knowledge ofthese factors and processes, and to summarize in concise and objective terms our best present understanding of thecarbon dioxide/climate issue for the bene&#64257;t of policy-makers.&#8221;The report is just 33 pages long, it is free to download [<span class="tinylink">5qfkaw</span>], and I recommend it. It makes clear which bits of thescience were already settled in 1979, and which bits still had uncertainty.Here are the main points I picked up from this report. First, doubling the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration wouldchange the net heating of the troposphere, oceans, and land by an average power per unit area of roughly 4 W/m<sup>2</sup>,if all other properties of the atmosphere remained unchanged. This heating effect can be compared with the averagepower absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and oceans, which is 238 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So doubling CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations wouldhave a warming effect equivalent to increasing the intensity of the sun by 4/238 = 1.7%. Second, the consequencesof this CO<sub>2</sub>-induced heating are hard to predict, on account of the complexity of the atmosphere/ocean system, butthe authors predicted a global surface warming of between 2&deg;C and 3.5&deg;C, with greater increases at high latitudes.Finally, the authors summarize: &#8220;we have tried but have been unable to &#64257;nd any overlooked or underestimatedphysical effects that could reduce the currently estimated global warmings due to a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> tonegligible proportions or reverse them altogether.&#8221; They warn that, thanks to the ocean, &#8220;the great and ponderous&#64258;ywheel of the global climate system,&#8221; it is quite possible that the warming would occur suf&#64257;ciently sluggishly that it</p></div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:6em; "><img style="margin-left:4em" src="figure245.png" width="70" height="79"  alt="Weights of carbon atom and CO2 molecule"><div class="sidebarcaption" >The weights of an atom of carbon and amolecule of CO<sub>2</sub> are in the ratio 12 to 44,because the carbon atom weighs 12 unitsand the two oxygen atoms weigh 16 each.12 + 16 + 16 = 44.</div></div></div> <div id="book_sidebar"><div class="pos" id="rm"></div></div><div id="textcol"><div class="endnote"><div class="notes"><p>would be dif&#64257;cult to detect in the coming decades.

Nobody but a specialist has a feeling for what &#8220;a barrel of oil&#8221;or &#8220;a million BTUs&#8221; means in human terms. In this book, we&#8217;ll expresseverything in a single set of personal units that everyone can relate to.</p><p>The unit of <strong>energy</strong> I have chosen is the kilowatt-hour (kWh). Thisquantity is called &#8220;one unit&#8221; on electricity bills, and it costs a domestic userabout 10p in the UK in 2008. As we&#8217;ll see, most individual daily choicesinvolve amounts of energy equal to small numbers of kilowatt-hours.</p><p>When we discuss <strong>powers</strong> (rates at which we use or produce energy),the main unit will be the kilowatt-hour per day (kWh/d). We&#8217;ll also occa-sionally use the watt (40 W <span class="cong">&asymp;</span> 1kWh/d) and the kilowatt (1 kW = 1000 W= 24 kWh/d), as I&#8217;ll explain below. The kilowatt-hour per day is a nicehuman-sized unit: most personal energy-guzzling activities guzzle at arate of a small number of kilowatt-hours per day. For example, one 40 Wlightbulb, kept switched on all the time, uses <strong>one</strong> kilowatt-hour per day.Some electricity companies include graphs in their electricity bills, show-ing energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per day. I&#8217;ll use the same unitfor all forms of power, not just electricity. Petrol consumption, gas con-sumption, coal consumption: I&#8217;ll measure all these powers in kilowatt-hours per day. Let me make this clear: for some people, the word &#8220;power&#8221;means only <em>electrical</em> energy consumption. But this book concerns <em>all</em> formsof energy consumption and production, and I will use the word &#8220;power&#8221;for all of them.</p><p>One kilowatt-hour per day is roughly the power you could get fromone human servant. The number of kilowatt-hours per day you use is thusthe effective number of servants you have working for you.</p><p>People use the two terms energy and power interchangeably in ordi-nary speech, but in this book we must stick rigorously to their scienti&#64257;cde&#64257;nitions. <em>Power is the rate at which something uses energy</em>.</p><p>Maybe a good way to explain <span class="darkblue">energy</span> and <span class="mauve">power</span> is by an analogy with<span class="darkblue">water</span> and <span class="mauve">water-&#64258;ow</span> from taps. If you want a drink of water, you want a<em>volume</em> of water &#8211; one litre, perhaps (if you&#8217;re thirsty).

For example, whenever a toaster is switched on, itstarts to consume <em><span class="mauve"> power</span></em> at a rate of one kilowatt. It continues to consumeone kilowatt until it is switched off. To put it another way, the toaster (ifit&#8217;s left on permanently) consumes one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy perhour; it also consumes 24 kilowatt-hours per day.</p><p>The longer the toaster is on, the more <span class="darkblue"> energy</span> it uses.

The kilowatt-hour is equal to 3.6 million joules (3.6megajoules).</p><p>Powers are so useful and important, they have something that water&#64258;ows don&#8217;t have: they have their own special units. When we talk of a&#64258;ow, we might measure it in &#8220;litres per minute,&#8221; &#8220;gallons per hour,&#8221; or&#8220;cubic-metres per second;&#8221; these units&#8217; names make clear that the &#64258;ow is&#8220;a volume per unit time.&#8221; A power of <em> one joule per second</em> is called <em> one watt</em>.1000 joules per second is called one kilowatt. Let&#8217;s get the terminologystraight: the toaster uses one kilowatt. It doesn&#8217;t use &#8220;one kilowatt per sec-ond.&#8221; The &#8220;per second&#8221; is already built in to the de&#64257;nition of the kilowatt:one kilowatt means &#8220;one kilojoule per second.&#8221; Similarly we say &#8220;a nuclearpower station generates one gigawatt.&#8221; One gigawatt, by the way, is onebillion watts, one million kilowatts, or 1000 megawatts. So one gigawattis a million toasters. And the &#8220;g&#8221;s in gigawatt are pronounced hard, thesame as in &#8220;giggle.&#8221; And, while I&#8217;m tapping the blackboard, we capital-ize the &#8220;g&#8221; and &#8220;w&#8221; in &#8220;gigawatt&#8221; only when we write the abbreviation&#8220;GW.&#8221;</p><p>Please, never, ever say &#8220;one kilowatt per second,&#8221; &#8220;one kilowatt perhour,&#8221; or &#8220;one kilowatt per day;&#8221; none of these is a valid measure of power.The urge that people have to say &#8220;per something&#8221; when talking about theirtoasters is one of the reasons I decided to use the &#8220;kilowatt-hour per day&#8221;as my unit of power. I&#8217;m sorry that it&#8217;s a bit cumbersome to say and towrite.</p><p>Here&#8217;s one last thing to make clear: if I say &#8220;someone used a gigawatt-hour of energy,&#8221; I am simply telling you<em> how much</em> energy they used, not<em>how fast</em> they used it.

You could use a gigawatt-hour of energy byswitching on one million toasters for one hour, or by switching on 1000toasters for 1000 hours.</p><p>As I said, I&#8217;ll usually quote powers in kWh/d <em> per person</em>. One reasonfor liking these personal units is that it makes it much easier to move fromtalking about the UK to talking about other countries or regions. For ex-ample, imagine we are discussing waste incineration and we learn thatUK waste incineration delivers a power of 7 TWh per year and that Den-mark&#8217;s waste incineration delivers 10 TWh per year. Does this help us saywhether Denmark incinerates &#8220;more&#8221; waste than the UK? While the totalpower produced from waste in each country may be interesting, I thinkthat what we usually want to know is the waste incineration <em> per person</em>.(For the record, that is: Denmark, 5 kWh/d per person; UK, 0.3 kWh/dper person. So Danes incinerate about 13 times as much waste as Brits.) Tosave ink, I&#8217;ll sometimes abbreviate &#8220;per person&#8221; to &#8220;/p&#8221;. By discussing ev-erything per-person from the outset, we end up with a more transportablebook, one that will hopefully be useful for sustainable energy discussionsworldwide.</p><h2>Picky details</h2><h4>Isn&#8217;t energy conserved? We talk about &#8220;using&#8221; energy, but doesn&#8217;t one ofthe laws of nature say that energy can&#8217;t be created or destroyed?</h4><p>Yes, I&#8217;m being imprecise. This is really a book about <em> entropy</em> &#8211; a trickierthing to explain. When we &#8220;use up&#8221; one kilojoule of energy, what we&#8217;rereally doing is taking one kilojoule of energy in a form that has <em> low entropy</em>(for example, electricity), and <em> converting</em> it into an exactly equal amountof energy in another form, usually one that has much higher entropy (forexample, hot air or hot water). When we&#8217;ve &#8220;used&#8221; the energy, it&#8217;s stillthere; but we normally can&#8217;t &#8220;use&#8221; the energy over and over again, becauseonly <em> low entropy</em> energy is &#8220;useful&#8221; to us. Sometimes these different gradesof energy are distinguished by adding a label to the units: one kWh(e) isone kilowatt-hour of electrical energy &#8211; the highest grade of energy. OnekWh(th) is one kilowatt-hour of thermal energy &#8211; for example the energyin ten litres of boiling-hot water. Energy lurking in higher-temperaturethings is more useful (lower entropy) than energy in tepid things. A thirdgrade of energy is chemical energy. Chemical energy is high-grade energylike electricity.</p><p>It&#8217;s a convenient but sloppy shorthand to talk about the energy ratherthan the entropy, and that is what we&#8217;ll do most of the time in this book.Occasionally, we&#8217;ll have to smarten up this sloppiness; for example, whenwe discuss refrigeration, power stations, heat pumps, or geothermal power.</p><h4>Are you comparing apples and oranges? Is it valid to compare different</h4><div class="sidebarcaption" style="top:12em;">1TWh (one terawatt-hour) is equal toone billion kWh.</div></div> <div id="textcol"><h4>forms of energy such as the chemical energy that is fed into a petrol-powered car and the electricity from a wind turbine?</h4><p class="first" >By comparing consumed energy with conceivable produced energy, I donot wish to imply that all forms of energy are equivalent and interchange-able. The electrical energy produced by a wind turbine is of no use toa petrol engine; and petrol is no use if you want to power a television.In principle, energy can be converted from one form to another, thoughconversion entails losses. Fossil-fuel power stations, for example, guzzle<em>chemical energy</em> and produce <em>electricity</em> (with an ef&#64257;ciency of 40% or so).And aluminium plants guzzle <em> electrical energy</em> to create a product withhigh <em> chemical energy</em> &#8211; aluminium (with an ef&#64257;ciency of 30% or so).</p><p>In some summaries of energy production and consumption, all the dif-ferent forms of energy are put into the same units, but multipliers areintroduced, rating electrical energy from hydroelectricity for example asbeing worth 2.5 times more than the chemical energy in oil. This bumpingup of electricity&#8217;s effective energy value can be justi&#64257;ed by saying, &#8220;well,1 kWh of electricity is equivalent to 2.5 kWh of oil, because if we put thatmuch oil into a standard power station it would deliver 40% of 2.5 kWh,which is 1 kWh of electricity.&#8221; In this book, however, I will usually use aone-to-one conversion rate when comparing different forms of energy. Itis <em> not</em> the case that 2.5 kWh of oil is inescapably equivalent to 1 kWh ofelectricity; that just happens to be the perceived exchange rate in a world-view where oil is used to make electricity. Yes, conversion of chemicalenergy to electrical energy is done with this particular inef&#64257;cient exchangerate. But electrical energy can also be converted to chemical energy. In analternative world (perhaps not far-off) with relatively plentiful electricityand little oil, we might use electricity to make liquid fuels; in that worldwe would surely not use the same exchange rate &#8211; each kWh of gasolinewould then cost us something like 3 kWh of electricity! I think the timelessand scienti&#64257;c way to summarize and compare energies is to hold 1 kWhof chemical energy equivalent to 1 kWh of electricity. My choice to usethis one-to-one conversion rate means that some of my sums will look abit different from other people&#8217;s. (For example, BP&#8217;s <em> Statistical Review ofWorld Energy</em> rates 1 kWh of electricity as equivalent to 100/38 <span class="cong">&asymp;</span> 2.6 kWhof oil; on the other hand, the government&#8217;s <em> Digest of UK Energy Statistics</em>uses the same one-to-one conversion rate as me.) And I emphasize again,this choice does not imply that I&#8217;m suggesting you could convert eitherform of energy directly into the other. Converting chemical energy intoelectrical energy always wastes energy, and so does converting electricalinto chemical energy.</p><h2>Physics and equations</h2><p class="first">Throughout the book, my aim is not only to work out numbers indicatingour current energy consumption and conceivable sustainable production,</p></div> <div id="textcol"><p class="first">but also to make clear <em> what these numbers depend on</em>. Understanding whatthe numbers depend on is essential if we are to choose sensible policiesto change any of the numbers. Only if we understand the physics behindenergy consumption and energy production can we assess assertions suchas &#8220;cars waste 99% of the energy they consume; we could redesign cars sothat they use 100 times less energy.&#8221; Is this assertion true? To explain theanswer, I will need to use equations like</p><div class="equation" style="margin:10px 0 10px 0"><img src="figure10.png"  alt=" "></div><p class="first">However, I recognize that to many readers, such formulae are a foreign lan-guage.

Any reader with a high-school/secondary-school quali&#64257;cation in maths, physics, or chemistry should enjoy thesetechnical chapters.

I don&#8217;t have all the answers, and the numbers I offer are open torevision and correction. (Indeed I expect corrections and will publish themon the book&#8217;s website.) The one thing I <em> am</em> sure of is that the answers toour sustainable energy questions will involve <em> numbers</em> ; any sane discussionof sustainable energy requires numbers.

Chapter C allows us to answer questions suchas &ldquo;would air travel consume significantly less energy if we travelled inslower planes?&rdquo; The answer is <strong>no</strong>: in contrast to wheeled vehicles, whichcan get more efficient the slower they go, planes are already almost asenergy-efficient as they could possibly be. Planes unavoidably have to useenergy for two reasons: they have to throw air down in order to stay up,and they need energy to overcome air resistance. No redesign of a planeis going to radically improve its efficiency. A 10% improvement? Yes,possible. A doubling of efficiency?

To get the power per m<sup>2</sup> of <em>land area</em> in Britain, wemust make several corrections. We need to compensate for the tilt betweenthe sun and the land, which reduces the intensity of midday sun to about60% of its value at the equator (figure 6.1). We also lose out because it isnot midday all the time. On a cloud-free day in March or September, theratio of the <em>average</em> intensity to the midday intensity is about 32%. Finally,we lose power because of cloud cover.

Typical solarpanels have an efficiency of about 10%; expensive ones perform at 20%.(Fundamental physical laws limit the efficiency of photovoltaic systems toat best 60% with perfect concentrating mirrors or lenses, and 45% withoutconcentration. A mass-produced device with efficiency greater than 30%would be quite remarkable.)

So we have to choose whether to have thephotovoltaic contribution or the solar hot water contribution. But I&rsquo;ll justplop both these on the production stack anyway. Incidentally, the presentcost of installing such photovoltaic panels is about four times the cost ofinstalling solar thermal panels, but they deliver only half as much energy,albeit high-grade energy (electricity). So I&rsquo;d advise a family thinking ofgoing solar to investigate the solar thermal option first. The smartest solu-tion, at least in sunny countries, is to make combined systems that deliverboth electricity and hot water from a single installation. This is the approachpioneered by Heliodynamics, who reduce the overall cost of theirsystems by surrounding small high-grade gallium arsenide photovoltaicunits with arrays of slowly-moving flat mirrors; the mirrors focus the sun-light onto the photovoltaic units, which deliver both electricity and hotwater; the hot water is generated by pumping water past the back of thephotovoltaic units.</p><p>The conclusion so far: covering your south-facing roof at home withphotovoltaics may provide enough juice to cover quite a big chunk of yourpersonal average electricity consumption; but roofs are not big enough tomake a huge dent in our total <em>energy</em> consumption.

Yes, no problem: windmills cast little shadow, andground-level solar panels have negligible effect on the wind. How auda-cious is this plan? The solar power capacity required to deliver this 50 kWhper day per person in the UK is more than 100 times all the photovoltaicsin the whole world. So should I include the PV farm in my sustainableproduction stack? I&rsquo;m in two minds. At the start of this book I said Iwanted to explore what the laws of physics say about the limits of sus-tainable energy, assuming money is no object. On those grounds, I shouldcertainly go ahead, industrialize the countryside, and push the PV farmonto the stack. At the same time, I want to help people figure out whatwe should be doing between <em>now</em> and 2050. And today, electricity fromsolar farms would be four times as expensive as the market rate. So I feela bit irresponsible as I include this estimate in the sustainable productionstack in figure 6.9 &ndash; paving 5% of the UK with solar panels seems beyondthe bounds of plausibility in so many ways. If we seriously contemplateddoing such a thing, it would quite probably be better to put the panels ina two-fold sunnier country and send some of the energy home by powerlines.

But this chapter&rsquo;s photo-voltaic estimates weren&rsquo;t constrained by the economic cost of the panels,nor by the energy cost of their manufacture.

This is simply not true. Ona bright but cloudy day, solar photovoltaic panels and plants do continue toconvert some energy, but much less: photovoltaic production falls roughlyten-fold when the sun goes behind clouds (because the intensity of the in-coming sunlight falls ten-fold). As figure 6.15 shows, the power deliveredby photovoltaic panels is almost exactly proportional to the intensity of thesunlight &ndash; at least, if the panels are at 25&deg;C. To complicate things, the powerdelivered depends on temperature too &ndash; hotter panels have reduced power(typically 0.38% loss in power per &deg;C) &ndash; but if you check data from real pan-els, e.g. at <span class="websitetitle">www.solarwarrior.com</span>, you can confirm the main point: outputon a cloudy day is <em>far less</em> than on a sunny day.

Thisis a quote from Hopfield and Gollub (1978), who were writing about panelswithout concentrating mirrors or lenses. The theoretical limit for a standard&ldquo;single-junction&rdquo; solar panel without concentrators, the Shockley&ndash;Queisserlimit, says that at most 31% of the energy in sunlight can be converted toelectricity (Shockley and Queisser, 1961). (The main reason for this limitis that a standard solar material has a property called its band-gap, whichdefines a particular energy of photon that that material converts most ef-ficiently. Sunlight contains photons with many energies; photons with en-ergy <em>below</em> the band-gap are not used at all; photons with energy <em>greater</em>than the band-gap may be captured, but all their energy in excess of theband-gap is lost.) Concentrators (lenses or mirrors) can both reduce thecost (per watt) of photovoltaic systems, and increase their efficiency. TheShockley&ndash;Queisser limit for solar panels with concentrators is 41% efficiency.The only way to beat the Shockley&ndash;Queisser limit is to make fancy photo-voltaic devices that split the light into different wavelengths, processing eachwavelength-range with its own personalized band-gap. These are calledmultiple-junction photovoltaics. Recently multiple-junction photovoltaicswith optical concentrators have been reported to be about 40% efficient.[<span class="tinylink">2tl7t6</span>], <span class="websitetitle">www.spectrolab.com</span>. In July 2007, the University of Delawarereported 42.8% efficiency with 20-times concentration [<span class="tinylink">6hobq2</span>], [<span class="tinylink">2lsx6t</span>]. InAugust 2008, NREL reported 40.8% efficiency with 326-times concentration[<span class="tinylink">62ccou</span>]. Strangely, both these results were called world efficiency records.What multiple-junction devices are available on the market?

Archer and Barber suggest thatby genetic modification, it might be possible to improve the storage efficiencyof plants, especially <em>C4 plants</em>, which have already naturally evolved a moreefficient photosynthetic pathway. C4 plants are mainly found in the trop-ics and thrive in high temperatures; they don&rsquo;t grow at temperatures below10&deg;C. Some examples of C4 plants are sugarcane, maize, sorghum, fingermillet, and switchgrass. Zhu et al.

They say that the highest solar energy conversionefficiencies reported for C3 and C4 crops are 2.4% and 3.7% respectively;and, citing Boyer (1982), that the average conversion efficiencies of majorcrops in the US are 3 or 4 times lower than those record efficiencies (thatis, about 1% efficient). One reason that plants don&rsquo;t achieve the theoreticallimit is that they have insufficient capacity to use all the incoming radiationof bright sunlight.

The power of a small electric bar fire or electric fan heater is 1 kW(24 kWh per day). In winter, you might need one of these per person tokeep toasty. In summer, none. So we estimate that on average one modernperson <em>needs</em> to use 12 kWh per day on hot air. But most people use morethan they need, keeping several rooms warm simultaneously (kitchen, livingroom, corridor, and bathroom, say). So a plausible consumption figurefor hot air is about double that: <span class="red">24 kWh per day per person</span>.</p><p>This chapter&rsquo;s companion Chapter E contains a more detailed accountof where the heat is going in a building; this model makes it possible to</p><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Table 7.4</span>.

To estimate the gravitational power of low-land rain, we multiply the rainfall in Bedford (584 mm per year) by thedensity of water (1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>), the strength of gravity (10 m/s<sup>2</sup>) and thetypical lowland altitude above the sea (say 100 m). The power per unitarea works out to 0.02 W/m<sup>2</sup>. That&rsquo;s the power per unit area of land onwhich rain falls.</p><p>When we multiply this by the area per person (2700 m<sup>2</sup>, if the lowlandsare equally shared between all 60 million Brits), we find an average rawpower of about 1 kWh per day per person. This is the absolute upperlimit for lowland hydroelectric power, if every river were dammed andevery drop perfectly exploited. Realistically, we will only ever dam riverswith substantial height drops, with catchment areas much smaller than thewhole country. Much of the water evaporates before it gets anywhere neara turbine, and no hydroelectric system exploits the full potential energy ofthe water. We thus arrive at a firm conclusion about lowland water power.People may enjoy making &ldquo;run-of-the-river&rdquo; hydro and other small-scalehydroelectric schemes, but such lowland facilities can never deliver morethan 1 kWh per day per person.</p><div><img style="margin-top:2em" src="figure407.png" width="400" height="291" alt=""></div><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure64.png" width="219" height="148" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 8.1</span>.

Kinlochewe is a rainier spot: it gets 2278 mmper year, four times more than Bedford. The height drops there are biggertoo &ndash; large areas of land are above 300 m. So overall a twelve-fold increasein power per square metre is plausible for mountainous regions. The rawpower per unit area is roughly 0.24 W/m<sup>2</sup>. If the highlands generouslyshare their hydro-power with the rest of the UK (at 1300 m<sup>2</sup> area per per-son), we find an upper limit of about 7 kWh per day per person.

Source: MacLeay et al. (2007). In 2006, large-scale hydro pro-duced 3515 GWh (from plant with a capacity of 1.37 GW); small-scale hydro,212 GWh (0.01 kWh/d/p) (from a capacity of 153 MW).In 1943, when the growth of hydroelectricity was in full swing, the Northof Scotland Hydroelectricity Board&rsquo;s engineers estimated that the Highlandsof Scotland could produce 6.3 TWh per year in 102 facilities &ndash; that wouldcorrespond to 0.3 kWh/d per person in the UK (Ross, 2008).Glendoe, the first new large-scale hydroelectric project in the UK since 1957,will add capacity of 100 MW and is expected to deliver 180 GWh per year.Glendoe&rsquo;s catchment area is 75 km<sup>2</sup>, so its power density works out to 0.27 Wper m<sup>2</sup> of catchment area. Glendoe has been billed as &ldquo;big enough to powerGlasgow.&rdquo; But if we share its 180 GWh per year across the population ofGlasgow (616 000 people), we get only 0.8 kWh/d per person. That is just5% of the average electricity consumption of 17 kWh/d per person. The 20-fold exaggeration is achieved by focusing on Glendoe&rsquo;s peak output ratherthan its average, which is 5 times smaller; and by discussing &ldquo;homes&rdquo; ratherthan the total electrical power of Glasgow (see p329).</p></div></div><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure65.png" width="215" height="457" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 8.3</span>.

A fluorescent tube can produce an equal amountof light using one quarter of the power of an incandescent bulb.</p><p>How much power does a moderately affluent person use for lighting?My rough estimate, based on table 9.2, is that a typical two-person homewith a mix of low-energy and high-energy bulbs uses about 5.5 kWh perday, or 2.7 kWh per day per person. I assume that each person also hasa workplace where they share similar illumination with their colleagues;guessing that the workplace uses 1.3 kWh/d per person, we get a roundfigure of 4 kWh/d per person.</p><h2>Street-lights and traffic lights</h2><p class="first">Do we need to include public lighting too, to get an accurate estimate, ordo home and work dominate the lighting budget? Street-lights in fact useabout 0.1 kWh per day per person, and traffic lights only 0.005 kWh/d perperson &ndash; both negligible, compared with our home and workplace lighting.What about other forms of public lighting &ndash; illuminated signs and bollards,for example? There are fewer of them than street-lights; and street-lightsalready came in well under our radar, so we don&rsquo;t need to modify ouroverall estimate of 4 kWh/d per person.</p><h2>Lights on the traffic</h2><p class="first">In some countries, drivers must switch their lights on whenever their caris moving. How does the extra power required by that policy comparewith the power already being used to trundle the car around? Let&rsquo;s saythe car has four incandescent lights totalling 100 W. The electricity forthose bulbs is supplied by a 25%-efficient engine powering a 55%-efficientgenerator, so the power required is 730 W. For comparison, a typical cargoing at an average speed of 50 km/h and consuming one litre per 12 km</p><table class="layout framed" style="margin:2em 0 0 0.5em" summary=""><tr><th style="text-align:left; width:5em">Device</th><th style="text-align:right; width:4em">power</th><th style="text-align:right; width:6em">Time per day</th><th style="text-align:right; width:8em">Energy per dayper home</th></tr><tr><td>10 incandescent lights</td><td class="vc">1 kW</td><td class="vc">5 h</td><td class="vc">5 kWh</td></tr><tr><td class="bottom">10 low-energy lights</td><td class="vc bottom">0.1 kW</td><td class="vc bottom">5 h</td><td class="vc bottom">0.5 kWh</td></tr></table><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure67.png" width="216" height="457" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 9.1</span>.

So having the lights onwhile driving requires 2% extra power.</p><p>What about the future&rsquo;s electric cars? The power consumption of atypical electric car is about 5000 W. So popping on an extra 100 W wouldincrease its consumption by 2%. Power consumption would be smallerif we switched all car lights to light-emitting diodes, but if we pay anymore attention to this topic, we will be coming down with a severe case ofevery-little-helps-ism.</p><h2>The economics of low-energy bulbs</h2><p class="first">Generally I avoid discussing economics, but I&rsquo;d like to make an exceptionfor lightbulbs. Osram&rsquo;s 20 W low-energy bulb claims the same lightoutput as a 100 W incandescent bulb. Moreover, its lifetime is said to be15 000 hours (or &ldquo;12 years,&rdquo; at 3 hours per day). In contrast a typical in-candescent bulb might last 1000 hours. So during a 12-year period, youhave this choice (figure 9.3): buy 15 incandescent bulbs and 1500 kWh ofelectricity (which costs roughly &pound;150); or buy one low-energy bulb and300 kWh of electricity (which costs roughly &pound;30).</p><h4>Should I wait until the old bulb dies before replacing it?</h4><p>It feels like a waste, doesn&rsquo;t it? Someone put resources into making theold incandescent lightbulb; shouldn&rsquo;t we cash in that original investmentby using the bulb until it&rsquo;s worn out? But the economic answer is clear:<em>continuing to use an old lightbulb is throwing good money after bad</em>. If youcan find a satisfactory low-energy replacement, replace the old bulb now.</p><h4>What about the mercury in compact fluorescent lights? Are LEDbulbs better than fluorescents?</h4><p>Researchers say that LED (light-emitting diode) bulbs will soon be evenmore energy-efficient than compact fluorescent lights. The efficiency of alight is measured in <em>lumens per watt</em>. I checked the numbers on my latestpurchases: the Philips Genie 11 W compact fluorescent bulb (figure 9.4)has a brightness of 600 lumens, which is an efficiency of <strong>55 lumens perwatt</strong>; regular incandescent bulbs deliver <strong>10 lumens per watt</strong>; the Omicron1.3 W lamp, which has 20 white LEDs hiding inside it, has a brightnessof 46 lumens, which is an efficiency of <strong>35 lumens per watt</strong>. So this LEDbulb is almost as efficient as the fluorescent bulb. The LED industry stillhas a little catching up to do. In its favour, the LED bulb has a life of50 000 hours, eight times the life of the fluorescent bulb. As I write, Isee that <span class="websitetitle">www.cree.com</span> is selling LEDs with a power of <strong>100 lumens perwatt</strong>. It&rsquo;s projected that in the future, white LEDs will have an efficiencyof over 150 lumens per watt [<span class="tinylink">ynjzej</span>]. I expect that within another coupleof years, the best advice, from the point of view of both energy efficiencyand avoiding mercury pollution, will be to use LED bulbs.</p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure68.png" width="200" height="407" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 9.3</span>.

The Kentish Flats wind farm in the Thames Estuary, about 8.5 km offshore from Whitstable and Herne Bay, which started operation at the end of 2005, was predicted to have an average power per unit area of 3.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>.

It is conventional to distinguish between <em>shallow</em> offshore wind and <em>deep</em> offshore wind, as illustrated in figure 10.2. Conven- tional wisdom seems to be that <em>shallow</em> offshore wind (depth less than 25&ndash; 30 m), while roughly twice as costly as land-based wind, is economically feasible, given modest subsidy; and <em>deep</em> offshore wind is at present not economically feasible. As of 2008, there&rsquo;s just one deep offshore windfarm in UK waters, an experimental prototype sending all its electricity to a nearby oilrig called Beatrice. </p><h2>Shallow offshore</h2><p class="first">Within British territorial waters, the shallow area is about 40 000 km<sup>2</sup>, most of it off the coast of England and Wales. This area is about two Waleses. </p><p>The average power available from shallow offshore wind farms occu- pying the whole of this area would be 120 GW, or 48 kWh/d per person. But it&rsquo;s hard to imagine this arrangement being satisfactory for shipping. Substantial chunks of this shallow water would, I&rsquo;m sure, remain off-limits for wind farms. The requirement for shipping corridors and fishing areas must reduce the plausibly-available area; I propose that we assume the available fraction is one third (but please see this chapter&rsquo;s end-notes for a more pessimistic view!). So we estimate the maximum plausible power from shallow offshore wind to be <span class="green">16 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><p>Before moving on, I want to emphasize the large area &ndash; two thirds of a Wales &ndash; that would be required to deliver this 16 kWh/d per person.

To put it another way, consider the number of turbines re- quired. 16 kWh/d per person would be delivered by 44 000 &ldquo;3 MW&rdquo; tur- bines, which works out to 15 per kilometre of coastline, if they were evenly spaced around 3000 km of coast. </p><p>Offshore wind is tough to pull off because of the corrosive effects of sea water.

The Kentish Flats turbines seem to be having similar problems with their gearboxes, one third needing replacement during the first 18 months. </p><h2>Deep offshore</h2><p class="first">The area with depths between 25 m and 50 m is about 80 000 km<sup>2</sup> &ndash; the size of Scotland. Assuming again a power per unit area of 3 W/m<sup>2</sup>, &ldquo;deep&rdquo; off- shore wind farms could deliver another 240 GW, or 96 kWh/d per person, if turbines completely filled this area. Again, we must make corridors for shipping. I suggest as before that we assume we can use one third of the area for wind farms; this area would then be about 30% bigger than Wales, </p><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 10.2</span>.

The outcome: if an area equal to a 9 km-wide strip all round the coast were filled with tur- bines, deep offshore wind could deliver a power of <span class="green">32 kWh/d per person</span>. A huge amount of power, yes; but still no match for our huge consumption. And we haven&rsquo;t spoken about the issue of wind&rsquo;s intermittency. We&rsquo;ll come back to that in Chapter 26. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll include this potential deep offshore contribution in the production stack, with the proviso, as I said before, that wind experts reckon deep offshore wind is prohibitively expensive. </p><h2>Some comparisons and costs</h2><p class="first">So, how&rsquo;s our race between consumption and production coming along? Adding both shallow and deep offshore wind to the production stack, the green stack has a lead. Something I&rsquo;d like you to notice about this race, though, is this contrast: how <em>easy</em> it is to toss a bigger log on the consumption fire, and how <em>difficult</em> it is to grow the production stack. As I write this paragraph, I&rsquo;m feeling a little cold, so I step over to my thermostat and turn it up. It&rsquo;s so simple for me to consume an extra 30 kWh per day. But squeezing an extra 30 kWh per day per person from renewables requires an industrialization of the environment so large it is hard to imagine. </p><p>To create 48 kWh per day of offshore wind per person in the UK would require <span class="darkblue">60 million tons of concrete and steel</span> &ndash; one ton per person. Annual world steel production is about 1200 million tons, which is 0.2 tons per person in the world. During the second world war, American shipyards built 2751 Liberty ships, each containing 7000 tons of steel &ndash; that&rsquo;s a total of 19 million tons of steel, or 0.1 tons per American. So the building of 60 million tons of wind turbines is not off the scale of achievability; but don&rsquo;t kid yourself into thinking that it&rsquo;s easy. Making this many windmills is as big a feat as building the Liberty ships. </p><p>For comparison, to make 48 kWh per day of nuclear power per person in the UK would require <span class="darkblue">8 million tons of steel</span> and <span class="darkblue">0.14 million tons<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#62><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> of concrete</span>. We can also compare the 60 million tons of offshore wind hardware that we&rsquo;re trying to imagine with the existing fossil-fuel hardware already sitting in and around the North Sea (figure 10.4). In 1997, 200 installations and 7000 km of pipelines in the UK waters of the North Sea contained <span class="darkblue">8 million tons of steel and concrete</span>. The newly built Langeled gas pipeline from Norway to Britain, which will convey gas with a power of 25 GW (10 kWh/d/p), used another <span class="darkblue">1 million tons of steel and 1 million tons of concrete</span> (figure 10.5). </p><p>The UK government announced on 10th December 2007 that it would permit the creation of 33 GW of offshore wind capacity (which would deliver on average 10 GW to the UK, or 4.4 kWh per day per person), a plan branded &ldquo;pie in the sky&rdquo; by some in the wind industry. Let&rsquo;s run with a round figure of 4 kWh per day per person. This is one quarter of my </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure72.png" width="212" height="624" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 10.3</span>. Offshore wind.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">shallow 16 kWh per day per person. To obtain this average power requires roughly 10 000 &ldquo;3 MW&rdquo; wind turbines like those in figure 10.1. (They have a capacity of &ldquo;3 MW&rdquo; but on average they deliver 1 MW. I pop quotes round &ldquo;3 MW&rdquo; to indicate that this is a capacity, a peak power.) </p><p>What would this &ldquo;33 GW&rdquo;&rsquo; of power cost to erect? Well, the &ldquo;90 MW&rdquo; Kentish Flats farm cost &pound;105 million, so &ldquo;33 GW&rdquo; would cost about &pound;33 billion. One way to clarify this &pound;33 billion cost of offshore wind delivering 4 kWh/d per person is to share it among the UK population; that comes out to &pound;550 per person. This is a much better deal, incidentally, than micro- turbines. A roof-mounted microturbine currently costs about &pound;1500 and, even at a very optimistic windspeed of 6 m/s, delivers only 1.6 kWh/d. In reality, in a typical urban location in England, such microturbines deliver 0.2 kWh per day. </p><p>Another bottleneck constraining the planting of wind turbines is the special ships required. To erect 10 000 wind turbines (&ldquo;33 GW&rdquo;) over a period of 10 years would require roughly 50 jack-up barges. These cost &pound;60 million each, so an extra capital investment of &pound;3 billion would be required. Not a show-stopper compared with the &pound;33bn price tag already quoted, but the need for jack-up barges is certainly a detail that requires some forward planning. </p><h3>Costs to birds</h3><p class="first">Do windmills kill &ldquo;huge numbers&rdquo; of birds? Wind farms recently got ad- verse publicity from Norway, where the wind turbines on Smola, a set of islands off the north-west coast, killed 9 white-tailed eagles in 10 months. I share the concern of BirdLife International for the welfare of rare birds. But I think, as always, it&rsquo;s important to do the numbers. It&rsquo;s been esti- mated that 30 000 birds per year are killed by wind turbines in Denmark, where windmills generate 9%<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#63><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> of the electricity. Horror! Ban windmills! We also learn, moreover, that <em>traffic</em> kills <em>one million</em> birds per year in Den- mark. Thirty-times-greater horror! Thirty-times-greater incentive to ban cars! And in Britain, 55 million birds per year are killed by <em>cats</em> (figure 10.6). </p><p>Going on emotions alone, I would like to live in a country with virtually no cars, virtually no windmills, and with plenty of cats and birds (with the cats that prey on birds perhaps being preyed upon by Norwegian white- tailed eagles, to even things up). But what I really hope is that decisions about cars and windmills are made by careful rational thought, not by emotions alone. Maybe we do need the windmills! </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure74.png" width="208" height="439" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 10.4</span>.

The Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s (2002) document &ldquo;Future Offshore&rdquo; gives a detailed breakdown of areas that are useful for offshore wind power. Table 10.7 shows the estimated resource in 76 000 km<sup>2</sup> of shallow and deep water. The DTI&rsquo;s estimated power contribution, if these areas were <em>entirely</em> filled with windmills, is 146 kWh/d per person (consisting of 52 kWh/d/p from the shallow and 94 kWh/d/p from the deep). But the DTI&rsquo;s estimate of the potential offshore wind generation resource is just <span class="green">4.6 kWh per day per person</span>. It might be interesting to describe how they get down from this potential resource of 146 kWh/d per person to 4.6 kWh/d per person. Why a final figure so much lower than ours? First, they imposed these limits: the water must be within 30 km of the shore and less than 40 m deep; the sea bed must not have gradient greater than 5&deg;; shipping lanes, military zones, pipelines, fishing grounds, and wildlife reserves are excluded. Second, they assumed that only 5% of potential sites will be developed (as a result of seabed composition or planning constraints); they reduced the capacity by 50% for all sites less than 10 miles from shore, for reasons of public ac- ceptability; they further reduced the capacity of sites with wind speed over 9 m/s by 95% to account for &ldquo;development barriers presented by the hostile environment;&rdquo; and other sites with average wind speed 8&ndash;9 m/s had their capacities reduced by 5%. </p><p><span class="mark">61</span><em class="darkred">...if we take the total coastline of Britain (length: 3000 km), and put a strip of turbines 4 km wide all the way round...</em> Pedants will say that &ldquo;the coastline of Britain is not a well-defined length, because the coast is a fractal.&rdquo; Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s a fractal.

Economic facts vary, however, and in April 2007 the estimated cost of offshore was up to &pound;92 per MWh (Dept. of Trade and Industry, 2007, p7). By April 2008, the price of offshore wind evidently went even higher: Shell pulled out of their commit- ment to build the London Array. It&rsquo;s because offshore wind is so expensive that the Government is having to increase the number of ROCs (renewable obligation certificates) per unit of offshore wind energy. The ROC is the unit of subsidy given out to certain forms of renewable electricity generation. The standard value of a ROC is &pound;45, with 1 ROC per MWh; so with a wholesale price of roughly &pound;40/MWh, renewable generators are getting paid &pound;85 per MWh. So 1 ROC per MWh is not enough subsidy to cover the cost of &pound;92 per MWh. In the same document, estimates for other renewables (medium lev- elized costs in 2010) are as follows. Onshore wind: &pound;65&ndash;89/MWh; co-firing of biomass: &pound;53/MWh; large-scale hydro: &pound;63/MWh; sewage gas: &pound;38/MWh; solar PV: &pound;571/MWh; wave: &pound;196/MWh; tide: &pound;177/MWh. &ldquo;Dale Vince, chief executive of green energy provider Ecotricity, which is engaged in building onshore wind farms, said that he supported the Gov- ernment&rsquo;s [offshore wind] plans, but only if they are not to the detriment of onshore wind. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous to overlook the fantastic resource we have in this country. . .

The BBC rams the message home:</p><blockquote class="fontstyle-normal"><p>&ldquo;65% of UK consumers leave chargers on.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>From the way reporters talk about these planet-destroying black ob- jects, it&rsquo;s clear that they are roughly as evil as Darth Vader. But how evil, exactly? </p><p>In this chapter we&rsquo;ll find out the truth about chargers. We&rsquo;ll also in- vestigate their cousins in the gadget parade: computers, phones, and TVs. Digital set-top boxes. Cable modems.

In our preferred units, this is a power consump- tion of about <span class="red">0.01 kWh per day</span>. For anyone whose consumption stack is over 100 kWh per day, the BBC&rsquo;s advice, <em>always unplug the phone charger</em>, could potentially reduce their energy consumption by one hundredth of one percent (if only they would do it). </p><blockquote><p>Every little helps!</p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t think so.

A three-watt-guzzling charger uses 0.07 kWh per day. I think that it&rsquo;s a good idea to switch off such a charger &ndash; it <em>will</em> save you three pounds per year. But don&rsquo;t kid yourself that you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;done your bit&rdquo; by so doing. 3W is only a tiny fraction of total energy consumption. </p><p>OK, that&rsquo;s enough bailing the Titanic with a teaspoon. Let&rsquo;s find out where the electricity is really being used. </p><h2>Gadgets that really suck</h2><p class="first">Table 11.4 shows the power consumptions, in watts, of a houseful of gad- gets. The first column shows the power consumption when the device is actually being used &ndash; for example, when a sound system is actually play- ing sound. The second column shows the consumption when the device is switched on, but sitting doing nothing. I was particularly shocked to find that a laser-printer sitting idle consumes 17 W &ndash; the same as the average consumption of a fridge-freezer! The third column shows the consump- tion when the gadget is explicitly asked to go to sleep or standby. The fourth shows the consumption when it is completely switched off &ndash; but still left plugged in to the mains. I&rsquo;m showing all these powers in watts &ndash; to convert back to our standard units, remember that 40 W is 1 kWh/d. A nice rule of thumb, by the way, is that each watt costs about one pound per year (assuming electricity costs 10p per kWh). </p><p>The biggest guzzlers are the computer, its screen, and the television, whose consumption is in the hundreds of watts, when on. Entertainment systems such as stereos and DVD players swarm in the computer&rsquo;s wake, many of them consuming 10 W or so. A DVD player may cost just &pound;20 in the shop, but if you leave it switched on all the time, it&rsquo;s costing you another &pound;10 per year. Some stereos and computer peripherals consume several watts even when switched off, thanks to their mains-transformers. To be sure that a gadget is truly off, you need to switch it off at the wall. </p><h3>Powering the hidden tendrils of the information age</h3><p class="first">According to Jonathan Koomey (2007), the computer-servers in US data- centres and their associated plumbing (air conditioners, backup power sys- tems, and so forth) consumed <span class="red">0.4 kWh per day per person</span> &ndash; just over 1% of US electricity consumption.

The &lsquo;wasted&rsquo; energy they put out heats my home, so it&rsquo;s not wasted.&rdquo;</h4><p>This myth is <em>True</em> for a few people, but only during the winter; but <em>False</em> for most. </p><p>If your house is being heated by electricity through ordinary bar fires or blower heaters then, yes, it&rsquo;s much the same as heating the house with any electricity-wasting appliances. But if you are in this situation, you should change the way you heat your house. Electricity is high-grade energy, and heat is low-grade energy. <em>It&rsquo;s a waste to turn electricity into heat</em>. To be precise, if you make only one unit of heat from a unit of electricity, that&rsquo;s a waste. Heaters called air-source heat pumps or ground-source heat pumps can do much better, delivering 3 or 4 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed. They work like back-to-front refrigerators, pumping heat into your house from the outside air (see Chapter 21). </p><p>For the rest, whose homes are heated by fossil fuels or biofuels, it&rsquo;s a good idea to avoid using electrical gadgets as a heat source for your home &ndash; at least for as long as our increases in electricity-demand are served from fossil fuels. It&rsquo;s better to burn the fossil fuel at home. The point is, if you use electricity from an ordinary fossil power station, more than half of the energy from the fossil fuel goes sadly up the cooling tower. Of the energy that gets turned into electricity, about 8% is lost in the transmission system. If you burn the fossil fuel in your home, more of the energy goes directly into making hot air for you. </p><h2>Notes and further reading</h2><div class="endnote"><p>page no.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="mark">68</span><em class="darkred">The BBC News has been warning us ... unplug your mobile-phone charger</em>.

They made additional interesting measurements: the charger, when connected to a fully-charged mobile phone, wastes 0.845 W; and when the charger is do- ing what it&rsquo;s meant to do, charging a partly-charged Nokia mobile, it wastes 4.146 W as heat.

The warmed water warms the air above it, and produces water vapour. The warmed air rises; as it rises it cools, and the water eventually re-condenses, forming clouds and rain. At its highest point, the air is cooled down further by the freezing blackness of space. The cold air sinks again. This great solar- powered pump drives air round and round in great convection rolls. From our point of view on the surface, these convection rolls produce the winds. Wind is second-hand solar energy. As wind rushes across open water, it generates waves. Waves are thus third-hand solar energy. (The waves that crash on a beach are nothing to do with the tides.) </p><p>In open water, waves are generated whenever the wind speed is greater than about 0.5 m/s. The wave crests move at about the speed of the wind that creates them, and in the same direction. The <em>wavelength</em> of the waves (the distance between crests) and the <em>period</em> (the time between crests) de- pend on the speed of the wind. The longer the wind blows for, and the greater the expanse of water over which the wind blows, the greater the <em>height</em> of the waves stroked up by the wind. Thus since the prevailing winds over the Atlantic go from west to east, the waves arriving on the At- lantic coast of Europe are often especially big. (The waves on the east coast of the British Isles are usually much smaller, so my estimates of potential wave power will focus on the resource in the Atlantic Ocean.) </p><p>Waves have long memory and will keep going in the same direction for days after the wind stopped blowing, until they bump into something. In seas where the direction of the wind changes frequently, waves born on different days form a superposed jumble, travelling in different directions. </p><p>If waves travelling in a particular direction encounter objects that ab- sorb energy from the waves &ndash; for example, a row of islands with sandy beaches &ndash; then the seas beyond the object are calmer. The objects cast a shadow, and there&rsquo;s less energy in the waves that get by. So, whereas sun- light delivers a power per unit <em>area</em>, waves deliver a power per unit <em>length</em> of coastline. You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it. You can&rsquo;t collect wave energy two miles off-shore <em>and</em> one mile off-shore. Or rather, you can try, but the two-mile facility will absorb energy that would have gone to the one-mile facility, and it won&rsquo;t be replaced. The fetch required for wind to stroke up big waves is thousands of miles. </p><p>We can find an upper bound on the maximum conceivable power that could be obtained from wave power by estimating the incoming power </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure84.png" width="219" height="150" alt=""></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:12em"><img src="figure85.png" width="218" height="282" alt=""></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:34em"><img src="figure83.png" width="221" height="150" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption">Figure 12.1. A Pelamis wave energy collector is a sea snake made of four sections. It faces nose-on towards the incoming waves. The waves make the snake flex, and these motions are resisted by hydraulic generators. The peak power from one snake is 750 kW; in the best Atlantic location one snake would deliver 300 kW on average. Photo from Pelamis wave power <span class="websitetitle">www.pelamiswave.com</span>.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">per unit length of exposed coastline, and multiplying by the length of coastline. We ignore the question of what mechanism could collect all this power, and start by working out how much power it is. </p><p>The power of Atlantic waves has been measured: it&rsquo;s about 40 kW per metre of exposed coastline. That sounds like a lot of power! If every- one owned a metre of coastline and could harness their whole 40 kW, that would be plenty of power to cover modern consumption. However, <em>our population is too big</em>. There is not enough Atlantic-facing coastline for ev- eryone to have their own metre. </p><p>As the map on p73 shows, Britannia rules about 1000 km of Atlantic coastline (one million metres), which is <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">60</span> m per person. So the total raw incoming power is 16 kWh per day per person. If we extracted all this power, the Atlantic, at the seaside, would be as flat as a millpond. Practical systems won&rsquo;t manage to extract all the power, and some of the power will inevitably be lost during conversion from mechanical energy to electricity. Let&rsquo;s assume that brilliant wave-machines are 50%-efficient at turning the incoming wave power into electricity, and that we are able to pack wave- machines along 500 km of Atlantic-facing coastline. That would mean we could deliver 25% of this theoretical bound. That&rsquo;s <span class="green">4 kWh per day per person</span>. As usual, I&rsquo;m intentionally making pretty extreme assumptions to boost the green stack &ndash; I expect the assumption that we could line <em>half of the Atlantic coastline</em> with wave absorbers will sound bananas to many readers. </p><p>How do the numbers assumed in this calculation compare with today&rsquo;s technology? As I write, there are just three wave machines working in deep water: three Pelamis wave energy collectors (figure 12.1) built in Scotland and deployed off Portugal. No actual performance results have been pub- lished, but the makers of the Pelamis (&ldquo;designed with survival as the key objective before power capture efficiency&rdquo;) predict that a two-kilometre- long wave-farm consisting of 40 of their sea-snakes would deliver 6 kW per metre of wave-farm. Using this number in the previous calculation, the power delivered by 500 kilometres of wave-farm is reduced to <span class="green">1.2 kWh per day per person</span>. While wave power may be useful for small commu- nities on remote islands, I suspect it can&rsquo;t play a significant role in the solution to Britain&rsquo;s sustainable energy problem. </p><p>What&rsquo;s the weight of a Pelamis, and how much steel does it contain? One snake with a maximum power of 750 kW weighs 700 tons, including 350 tons of ballast. So it has about 350 tons of steel. That&rsquo;s a weight-to- power ratio of roughly 500 kg per kW (peak). We can compare this with the steel requirements for offshore wind: an offshore wind-turbine with a maximum power of 3 MW weighs 500 tons, including its foundation. That&rsquo;s a weight-to-power ratio of about 170 kg per kW, one third of the wave machine&rsquo;s. The Pelamis is a first prototype; presumably with further investment and development in wave technology, the weight-to-power ra- tio would fall. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure86.png" width="212" height="640" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 12.2</span>.

The simplest theory of wave-production (Faber, 1995, p. 337) suggests that (for small waves) the wave crests move at about half the speed of the wind that creates them. It&rsquo;s found empirically however that, the longer the wind blows for, the longer the wavelength of the dominant waves present, and the greater their velocity. The characteristic speed of fully-developed seas is almost ex- actly equal to the wind-speed 20 metres above the sea surface (Mollison, 1986). </p><p><span class="mark">&ndash;</span><em class="darkred">The waves on the east coast of the British Isles are usually much smaller</em>.

Sinden says: &ldquo;The North Sea Region expe- riences a very low energy wave environment.&rdquo; </p><p><span class="mark">74</span><em class="darkred">Atlantic wave power is 40 kW per metre of exposed coastline</em>. (Chapter F explains how we can estimate this power using a few facts about waves.) This number has a firm basis in the literature on Atlantic wave power (Mollison et al., 1976; Mollison, 1986, 1991). From Mollison (1986), for example: &ldquo;the large scale resource of the NE Atlantic, from Iceland to North Portugal, has a net resource of 40&ndash;50 MW/km, of which 20&ndash;30 MW/km is potentially economically extractable.&rdquo; At any point in the open ocean, three powers per unit length can be distinguished: the total power passing through that point in all directions (63 kW/m on average at the Isles of Scilly and 67 kW/m off Uist); the net power intercepted by a directional collecting de- vice oriented in the optimal direction (47 kW/m and 45 kW/m respectively); and the power per unit coastline, which takes into account the misalignment between the optimal orientation of a directional collector and the coastline (for example in Portugal the optimal orientation faces northwest and the coastline faces west). </p><p><span class="mark">&ndash;</span><em class="darkred">Practical systems won&rsquo;t manage to extract all the power, and some of the power will inevitably be lost during conversion from mechanical energy to electricity</em>.

A &ldquo;Calorie,&rdquo; in food circles, is actually 1000 chemist&rsquo;s calories (1 kcal). 2600 &ldquo;Calories&rdquo; per day is about 3 kWh per day. Most of this energy eventually escapes from the body as heat, so one function of a typical person is to act as a space heaterwith an output of a little over 100 W, a medium-power lightbulb. Put 10 people in a small cold room, and you can switch off the 1 kW convection heater. </p><p>How much energy do we actually consume in order to get our 3 kWh per day? If we enlarge our viewpoint to include the inevitable upstream costs of food production, then we may find that our energy footprint is substantially bigger. It depends if we are vegan, vegetarian or carnivore. </p><p>The vegan has the smallest inevitable footprint: <span class="red">3 kWh per day</span> of en- ergy from the plants he eats. </p><h3>The energy cost of drinking milk</h3><p class="first">I love milk. If I drinka-pinta-milka-day, what energy does that require? A typical dairy cow produces 16 litres of milk per day. So my one pint per day (half a litre per day) requires that I employ <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">32</span> of a cow. Oh, hang on &ndash; I love cheese too. And to make 1 kg of Irish Cheddar takes about 9 kg of milk. So consuming 50 g of cheese per day requires the production of an extra 450 g of milk. OK: my milk and cheese habit requires that I employ <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span> of a cow. And how much power does it take to run a cow? Well, if a cow weighing 450 kg has similar energy requirements per kilogram to a human (whose 65 kg burns 3 kWh per day) then the cow must be using about 21 kWh/d. Does this extrapolation from human to cow make you uneasy? Let&rsquo;s check these numbers: <span class="websitetitle">www.dairyaustralia.com.au</span> says that a suckling cow of weight 450 kg needs 85 MJ/d, which is 24 kWh/d. Great, our guess wasn&rsquo;t far off! So my <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span> share of a cow has an energy consumption of about <span class="red">1.5 kWh per day</span>. This figure ignores other energy costs involved in persuading the cow to make milk and the milk to turn to cheese, and of getting the milk and cheese to travel from her to me. We&rsquo;ll cover some of these costs when we discuss freight and supermarkets in Chapter 15. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure89.png" width="221" height="170" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.1</span>.

Milk and cheese.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h3>Eggs</h3><p class="first">A &ldquo;layer&rdquo; (a chicken that lays eggs) eats about 110 g of chicken feed per day. Assuming that chicken feed has a metabolizable energy content of 3.3 kWh per kg, that&rsquo;s a power consumption of 0.4 kWh per day per chicken. Layers yield on average 290 eggs per year. So eating two eggs a day requires a power of <span class="red">1 kWh per day</span>. Each egg itself contains 80 kcal, which is about 0.1 kWh. So from an energy point of view, egg production is 20% efficient. </p><h3>The energy cost of eating meat</h3><p class="first">Let&rsquo;s say an enthusiastic meat-eater eats about half a pound a day (227 g). (This is the average meat consumption of Americans.) To work out the power required to maintain the meat-eater&rsquo;s animals as they mature and wait for the chop, we need to know for how long the animals are around, consuming energy. Chicken, pork, or beef? </p><p>Chicken, sir? Every chicken you eat was clucking around being a chicken for roughly 50 days. So the steady consumption of half a pound a day of chicken requires about 25 pounds of chicken to be alive, preparing to be eaten. And those 25 pounds of chicken consume energy. </p><p>Pork, madam? Pigs are around for longer &ndash; maybe 400 days from birth to bacon &ndash; so the steady consumption of half a pound a day of pork re- quires about 200 pounds of pork to be alive, preparing to be eaten. </p><p>Cow? Beef production involves the longest lead times. It takes about 1000 days of cow-time to create a steak. So the steady consumption of half a pound a day of beef requires about 500 pounds of beef to be alive, preparing to be eaten. </p><p>To condense all these ideas down to a single number, let&rsquo;s assume you eat half a pound (227 g) per day of meat, made up of equal quantities of chicken, pork, and beef. This meat habit requires the perpetual sustenance of 8 pounds of chicken meat, 70 pounds of pork meat, and 170 pounds of cow meat. That&rsquo;s a total of 110 kg of meat, or 170 kg of animal (since about two thirds of the animal gets turned into meat). And if the 170 kg of animal has similar power requirements to a human (whose 65 kg burns 3 kWh/d) then the power required to fuel the meat habit is </p><table class="fraction" style="margin:1em 0 1em 8em" summary=""><tr><td rowspan="2">170kg &#215;</td><td>3 kWh/d</td><td rowspan="2"><span class="cong">&asymp;</span> <span class="red">8 kWh/d</span></td></tr><tr><td class="upper_line">65 kg</td></tr></table><p class="first">I&rsquo;ve again taken the physiological liberty of assuming &ldquo;animals are like humans;&rdquo; a more accurate estimate of the energy to make chicken is in this chapter&rsquo;s endnotes. No matter, I only want a ballpark estimate, and here it is. The power required to make the food for a typical consumer of vegetables, dairy, eggs, and meat is 1.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 8 = <span class="red">12 kWh per day</span>. (The daily calorific balance of this rough diet is 1.5 kWh from vegetables; </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:6em"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure91.png" width="101" height="33" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 13.4</span>.

We&rsquo;ll estimate some of those costs below, and some in Chapter 15. </p><p>Do these calculations give an argument in favour of vegetarianism, on the grounds of lower energy consumption? It depends on where the ani- mals feed. Take the steep hills and mountains of Wales, for example. Could the land be used for anything other than grazing? Either these rocky pas- turelands are used to sustain sheep, or they are not used to help feed humans. You can think of these natural green slopes as maintenance-free biofuel plantations, and the sheep as automated self-replicating biofuel- harvesting machines. The energy losses between sunlight and mutton are substantial, but there is probably no better way of capturing solar power in such places. (I&rsquo;m not sure whether this argument for sheep-farming in Wales actually adds up: during the worst weather, Welsh sheep are moved to lower fields where their diet is supplemented with soya feed and other food grown with the help of energy-intensive fertilizers; what&rsquo;s the true energy cost? I don&rsquo;t know.) Similar arguments can be made in favour of carnivory for places such as the scrublands of Africa and the grasslands of Australia; and in favour of dairy consumption in India, where millions of cows are fed on by-products of rice and maize farming. </p><p>On the other hand, where animals are reared in cages and fed grain that humans could have eaten, there&rsquo;s no question that it would be more energy-efficient to cut out the middlehen or middlesow, and feed the grain directly to humans. </p><h3>Fertilizer and other energy costs in farming</h3><p class="first">The embodied energy in Europe&rsquo;s fertilizers is about <span class="red">2 kWh per day per person</span>. According to a report to DEFRA by the University of Warwick, farming in the UK in 2005 used an energy of <span class="red">0.9 kWh per day per person</span> for farm vehicles, machinery, heating (especially greenhouses), lighting, ventilation, and refrigeration. </p><h3>The energy cost of Tiddles, Fido, and Shadowfax</h3><p class="first">Animal companions!

It&rsquo;s certainly possible to find food whose fossil-fuel energy footprint is bigger than the energy delivered to the human. A bag of crisps, for example, has an embodied energy of 1.4 kWh of fossil fuel per kWh of chemical energy eaten. The embodied energy of meat is higher. According to a study from the University of Exeter, the typical diet has an embodied energy of roughly 6 kWh per kWh eaten. To figure out whether driving a car or walking uses less energy, we need to know the transport efficiency of each mode. For the typical car of Chapter 3, the energy cost was 80 kWh per 100 km. Walking uses a net energy of 3.6 kWh per 100 km &ndash; 22 times less. So if you live entirely on food whose footprint is greater than 22 kWh per kWh then, yes, the energy cost of getting you from A to B in a fossil-fuel-powered vehicle is less than if you go under your own steam. But if you have a typical diet (6 kWh per kWh) then &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better to drive than to walk&rdquo; is a myth. Walking uses one quarter as much energy. </p><h2>Notes and further reading</h2><div class="endnote"><p>page no.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="mark">76</span><em class="darkred">A typical dairy cow produces 16 litres of milk per day</em>.

Together they tour the sun once every year, at the same time whirling around each other once every 28 days. The moon also turns around once every 28 days so that she always shows the same face to her dancing part- ner, the earth. The prima donna earth doesn&rsquo;t return the compliment; she pirouettes once every day. This dance is held together by the force of grav- ity: every bit of the earth, moon, and sun is pulled towards every other bit of earth, moon, and sun. The sum of all these forces is <em>almost</em> exactly what&rsquo;s required to keep the whirling dance on course. But there are very slight imbalances between the gravitational forces and the forces required to maintain the dance. It is these imbalances that give rise to the tides. </p><p>The imbalances associated with the whirling of the moon and earth around each other are about three times as big as the imbalances associated with the earth&rsquo;s slower dance around the sun, so the size of the tides varies with the phase of the moon, as the moon and sun pass in and out of alignment. At full moon and new moon (when the moon and sun are in line with each other) the imbalances reinforce each other, and the resulting big tides are called <em>spring tides</em>. (Spring tides are <em>not</em> &ldquo;tides that occur at spring-time;&rdquo; spring tides happen every two weeks like clockwork.) At the intervening half moons, the imbalances partly cancel and the tides are smaller; these smaller tides are called <em>neap tides</em>. Spring tides have roughly twice the amplitude of neap tides: the spring high tides are twice as high above mean sea level as neap high tides, the spring low tides are twice as low as neap low tides, and the tidal currents are twice as big at springs as at neaps. </p><p>Why are there two high tides and two low tides per day? Well, if the earth were a perfect sphere, a smooth billiard ball covered by oceans, the tidal effect of the earth-moon whirling would be to deform the wa- ter slightly towards and away from the moon, making the water slightly rugby-ball shaped (figure 14.1). Someone living on the equator of this billiard-ball earth, spinning round once per day within the water cocoon, would notice the water level going up and down twice per day: up once as he passed under the nose of the rugby-ball, and up a second time as he passed under its tail. This cartoon explanation is some way from reality. In reality, the earth is not smooth, and it is not uniformly covered by water (as you may have noticed). Two humps of water cannot whoosh round the earth once per day because the continents get in the way. The true behaviour of the tides is thus more complicated. In a large body of water such as the Atlantic Ocean, tidal crests and troughs form but, unable to whoosh round the earth, they do the next best thing: they whoosh around the perimeter of the Ocean. In the North Atlantic there are two crests and two troughs, all circling the Atlantic in an anticlockwise direction once a </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:9em"><img src="figure96.png" width="191" height="98" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.1</span>. An ocean covering a billiard-ball earth. We&rsquo;re looking down on the North pole, and the moon is 60 cm off the page to the right. The earth spins once per day inside a rugby-ball-shaped shell of water. The oceans are stretched towards and away from the moon because the gravitational forces supplied by the moon don&rsquo;t perfectly match the required centripetal force to keep the earth and moon whirling around their common centre of gravity. Someone standing on the equator (rotating as indicated by the arrow) will experience two high waters and two low waters per day.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">day. Here in Britain we don&rsquo;t directly see these Atlantic crests and troughs &ndash; we are set back from the Atlantic proper, separated from it by a few hundred miles of paddling pool called the continental shelf. Each time one of the crests whooshes by in the Atlantic proper, it sends a crest up our paddling pool. Similarly each Atlantic trough sends a trough up the paddling pool. Consecutive crests and troughs are separated by six hours. Or to be more precise, by six and a quarter hours, since the time between moon-rises is about 25, not 24 hours. </p><p>The speed at which the crests and troughs travel varies with the depth of the paddling pool. The shallower the paddling pool gets, the slower the crests and troughs travel and the larger they get. Out in the ocean, the tides are just a foot or two in height. Arriving in European estuaries, the tidal range is often as big as four metres. In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force (a force, associated with the rotation of the earth, that acts only on moving objects) makes all tidal crests and troughs tend to hug the right-hand bank as they go. For example, the tides in the English channel are bigger on the French side. Similarly, the crests and troughs entering the North Sea around the Orkneys hug the British side, travelling down to the Thames Estuary then turning left at the Netherlands to pay their respects to Denmark. </p><p>Tidal energy is sometimes called lunar energy, since it&rsquo;s mainly thanks to the moon that the water sloshes around so. Much of the tidal energy, however, is really coming from the rotational energy of the spinning earth. The earth is very gradually slowing down. </p><p>So, how can we put tidal energy to use, and how much power could we extract? </p><h2>Rough estimates of tidal power</h2><p class="first">When you think of tidal power, you might think of an artificial pool next to the sea, with a water-wheel that is turned as the pool fills or empties (figures 14.2 and 14.3). Chapter G shows how to estimate the power avail- able from such tide-pools. Assuming a range of 4 m, a typical range in many European estuaries, the maximum power of an artificial tide-pool that&rsquo;s filled rapidly at high tide and emptied rapidly at low tide, generating power from both flow directions, is about <span class="green">3 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. This is the same as the power per unit area of an offshore wind farm. And we already know how big offshore wind farms need to be to make a difference. <em>They need to be country-sized</em>. So similarly, to make tide-pools capable of producing power comparable to Britain&rsquo;s total consumption, we&rsquo;d need the total area of the tide-pools to be similar to the area of Britain. </p><p>Amazingly, Britain is already supplied with a natural tide-pool of just the required dimensions. This tide-pool is known as the North Sea (figure 14.5). If we simply insert generators in appropriate spots, significant power can be extracted. The generators might look like underwater wind </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure97.png" width="215" height="233" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.2</span>.

Because the density of water is roughly 1000 times that of air, the power of water flow is 1000 times greater than the power of wind at the same speed. We&rsquo;ll come back to tide farms in a moment, but first let&rsquo;s discuss how much raw tidal energy rolls around Britain every day. </p><h3>Raw incoming tidal power</h3><p class="first">The tides around Britain are genuine tidal waves &ndash; unlike tsunamis, which are called &ldquo;tidal waves,&rdquo; but are nothing to do with tides. Follow a high tide as it rolls in from the Atlantic. The time of high tide becomes progress- ively later as we move east up the English channel from the Isles of Scilly to Portsmouth and on to Dover. The crest of the tidal wave progresses up the channel at about 70 km/h. (The crest of the wave moves much faster than the water itself, just as ordinary waves on the sea move faster than the water.) Similarly, a high tide moves clockwise round Scotland, rolling down the North Sea from Wick to Berwick and on to Hull at a speed of about 100 km/h. These two high tides converge on the Thames Estuary. By coincidence, the Scottish crest arrives about 12 hours later than the crest that came via Dover, so it arrives in near-synchrony with the next high tide via Dover, and London receives the normal two high tides per day. </p><p>The power we can extract from tides can never be more than the total power of these tidal waves from the Atlantic. The total power crossing the lines in figure 14.6 has been measured; on average it amounts to 100 kWh per day per person. If we imagine extracting 10% of this incident energy, and if the conversion and transmission processes are 50% efficient, the average power delivered would be <span class="green">5 kWh per day per person</span>. </p><p>This is a tentative first guess, made without specifying any technical </p><div class="sidebarcaption" style="top:26em"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.5</span>. The British Isles are in a fortunate position: the North Sea forms a natural tide-pool, in and out of which great sloshes of water pour twice a day.</div><div class="imgcap" style="top:30em"><img src="figure100.png" width="207" height="255" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.6</span>. The average incoming power of lunar tidal waves crossing these two lines has been measured to be 250 GW. This raw power, shared between 60 million people, is 100 kWh per day per person.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">details. Now let&rsquo;s estimate the power that could be delivered by three specific solutions: tide farms, barrages, and offshore tidal lagoons. </p><h2>Tidal stream farms</h2><p class="first">One way to extract tidal energy would be to build tide farms, just like wind farms. The first such underwater windmill, or &ldquo;tidal-stream&rdquo; generator, to be connected to the grid was a &ldquo;300 kW&rdquo; turbine, installed in 2003 near the northerly city of Hammerfest, Norway. Detailed power production results have not been published, and no-one has yet built a tide farm with more than one turbine, so we&rsquo;re going to have to rely on physics and guesswork to predict how much power tide farms could produce. Assuming that the rules for laying out a sensible tide farm are similar to those for wind farms, and that the efficiency of the tide turbines will be like that of the best wind turbines, table 14.7 shows the power of a tide farm for a few tidal currents. </p><p>Given that tidal currents of 2 to 3 knots are common, there are many places around the British Isles where the power per unit area of tide farm would be 6 W/m<sup>2</sup> or more. This power per unit area can be compared to our estimates for wind farms (2&ndash;3 W/m<sup>2</sup>) and for photovoltaic solar farms (5&ndash;10 W/m<sup>2</sup>). </p><p>Tide power is not to be sneezed at! How would it add up, if we assume that there are no economic obstacles to the exploitation of tidal power at all the hot spots around the UK? Chapter G lists the flow speeds in the best areas around the UK, and estimates that <span class="green">9 kWh/d per person</span> could be extracted. </p><h2>Barrages</h2><p class="first">Tidal barrages are a proven technology. The famous barrage at La Rance in France, where the tidal range is a whopping 8 metres on average, has produced an average power of 60 MW since 1966. The tidal range in the Severn Estuary is also unusually large. At Cardiff the range is 11.3 m at spring tides, and 5.8 m at neaps. If a barrage were put across the mouth of the Severn Estuary (from Weston-super-Mare to Cardiff), it would make a 500 km<sup>2</sup> tide-pool (figure 14.8). Notice how much bigger this pool is than the estuary at La Rance. What power could this tide-pool deliver, if we let the water in and out at the ideal times, generating on both the flood and the ebb? According to the theoretical numbers from table 14.4, when the range is 11.3 m, the average power contributed by the barrage (at 30 W/m<sup>2</sup>) would be at most 14.5 GW, or <strong>5.8 kWh/d per person</strong>. When the range is 5.8 m, the average power contributed by the barrage (at 8 W/m<sup>2</sup>) would be at most 3.9 GW, or <strong>1.6 kWh/d per person</strong>. These numbers assume that the water is let in in a single pulse at the peak of high tide, and let out in a single pulse at low tide. In practice, the in-flow and out-flow would be spread over a few hours, which would reduce the power delivered a little. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:2em"><table class="framed" id="p84" summary=""><tr><th id="th1" colspan="2">speed</th><th rowspan="2">power density (W/m<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr><tr id="r2"><th>(m/s)</th><th>(knots)</th></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>500</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>1000</td></tr></table><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Table 14.7</span>.

This reduces the power delivered by another 50%. The engineers&rsquo; reports on the proposed Severn barrage say that, generating on the ebb alone, it would contribute <span class="green">0.8 kWh/d per person</span> on average. The barrage would also provide protection from flooding valued at about &pound;120M per year. </p><h2>Tidal lagoons</h2><p class="first">Tidal lagoons are created by building walls in the sea; they can then be used like artificial estuaries. The required conditions for building lagoons are that the water must be shallow and the tidal range must be large. Economies of scale apply: big tidal lagoons make cheaper electricity than small ones. The two main locations for large tidal lagoons in Britain are the Wash on the east coast, and the waters off Blackpool on the west coast (figure 14.9). Smaller facilities could be built in north Wales, Lincolnshire, southwest Wales, and east Sussex. </p><p>If two lagoons are built in one location, a neat trick can be used to boost the power delivered and to enable the lagoons to deliver power on demand at any time, independent of the state of the tide. One lagoon can be designated the &ldquo;high&rdquo; lagoon, and the other the &ldquo;low&rdquo; lagoon. At low tide, some power generated by the emptying high lagoon can be used to </p><div class="sidebarcaption" style="top:34em"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.8</span>. The Severn barrage proposals (bottom left), and Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland (top left), shown on the same scale as the barrage at La Rance (bottom right). The map shows two proposed locations for a Severn barrage. A barrage at Weston-super-Mare would deliver an average power of 2 GW (0.8 kWh/d per person). The outer alternative would deliver twice as much. There is a big tidal resource in Northern Ireland at Strangford Lough. Strangford Lough&rsquo;s area is 150 km<sup>2</sup>; the tidal range in the Irish Sea outside is 4.5 m at springs and 1.5 m at neaps &ndash; sadly not as big as the range at La Rance or the Severn. The raw power of the natural tide-pool at Strangford Lough is roughly 150 MW, which, shared between the 1.7 million people of Northern Ireland, comes to 2 kWh/d per person. Strangford Lough is the location of the first grid-connected tidal stream generator in the UK.</div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">pump water <em>out</em> of the low lagoon, making its level even lower than low water. The energy required to pump down the level of the low lagoon is then repaid with interest at high tide, when power is generated by letting water into the low lagoon. Similarly, extra water can be pumped into the high lagoon at high tide, using energy generated by the low lagoon. Whatever state the tide is in, one lagoon or the other would be able to generate power. Such a pair of tidal lagoons could also work as a pumped storage facility, storing excess energy from the electricity grid. </p><p>The average power per unit area of tidal lagoons in British waters could be <span class="green">4.5W/m<sup>2</sup></span>, so if tidal lagoons with a total area of 800 km<sup>2</sup> were created (as indicated in figure 14.9), the power generated would be <span class="green">1.5 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h2>Beauties of tide</h2><p>Totting everything up, the barrage, the lagoons, and the tidal stream farms could deliver something like <span class="green">11 kWh/d per person</span> (figure 14.10). </p><p>Tide power has never been used on an industrial scale in Britain, so it&rsquo;s hard to know what economic and technical challenges will be raised as we build and maintain tide-turbines &ndash; corrosion, silt accumulation, entanglement with flotsam? But here are seven reasons for being excited about tidal power in the British Isles. 1. Tidal power is completely predictable; unlike wind and sun, tidal power is a renewable on which one could depend; it works day and night all year round; using tidal lagoons, energy can be stored so that power can be delivered on demand. 2. Successive high and low tides take about 12 hours to progress around the British Isles, so the strongest currents off Anglesey, Islay, Orkney and Dover occur at different times from each other; thus, together, a collection of tide farms could produce a more constant contribution to the electrical grid than one tide farm, albeit a contribution that wanders up and down with the phase of the moon. 3. Tidal power will last for millions of years. 4. It doesn&rsquo;t require high-cost hardware, in contrast to solar photovoltaic power. 5. Moreover, because the power density of a typical tidal flow is greater than the power density of a typical wind, a 1 MW tide turbine is smaller in size than a 1 MW wind turbine; perhaps tide turbines could therefore be cheaper than wind turbines. 6. Life below the waves is peaceful; there is no such thing as a freak tidal storm; so, unlike wind turbines, which require costly engineering to withstand rare windstorms, underwater tide turbines will not require big safety factors in their design. 7. Humans mostly live on the land, and they can&rsquo;t see under the sea, so objections to the visual impact of tide turbines should be less strong than the objections to wind turbines. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure102.png" width="207" height="225" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 14.9</span>.

In its natural life cycle, stuff passes through three stages. First, a new-born stuff is displayed in shiny packaging on a shelf in a shop. At this stage, stuff is called &ldquo;goods.&rdquo; As soon as the stuff is taken home and sheds its packaging, it undergoes a transformation from &ldquo;goods&rdquo; to its second form, &ldquo;clutter.&rdquo; The clutter lives with its owner for a period of months or years. During this period, the clutter is largely ignored by its owner, who is off at the shops buying more goods. Eventually, by a miracle of modern alchemy, the clutter is transformed into its final form, rubbish. To the untrained eye, it can be difficult to distinguish this &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; from the highly desirable &ldquo;good&rdquo; that it used to be. Nonetheless, at this stage the discerning owner pays the dustman to transport the stuff away. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s say we want to understand the full energy-cost of a stuff, perhaps with a view to designing better stuff. This is called life-cycle analysis. It&rsquo;s conventional to chop the energy-cost of anything from a hair-dryer to a cruise-ship into four chunks: </p><p class="hi"><strong>Phase R:</strong> Making <strong>raw materials</strong>. This phase involves digging minerals out of the ground, melting them, purifying them, and modifying them into manufacturers&rsquo; lego: plastics, glasses, metals, and ceramics, for example. The energy costs of this phase include the transportation costs of trundling the raw materials to their next destination. </p><p class="hi"><strong>Phase P: Production</strong>. In this phase, the raw materials are processed into a manufactured product. The factory where the hair-dryer&rsquo;s coils are wound, its graceful lines moulded, and its components carefully snapped together, uses heat and light. The energy costs of this phase include packaging and more transportation. </p><p class="hi"><strong>Phase U: Use</strong>. Hair-dryers and cruise-ships both guzzle energy when they&rsquo;re used as intended. </p><p class="hi"><strong>Phase D: Disposal</strong>. This phase includes the energy cost of putting the stuff back in a hole in the ground (landfill), or of turning the stuff back into raw materials (recycling); and of cleaning up all the pollution associated with the stuff. </p><p>To understand how much energy a stuff&rsquo;s life requires, we should estimate the energy costs of all four phases and add them up. Usually one of these four phases dominates the total energy cost, so to get a reasonable estimate of the total energy cost we need accurate estimates only of the cost of that dominant phase. If we wish to redesign a stuff so as to reduce its total energy cost, we should usually focus on reducing the cost of the dominant phase, while making sure that energy-savings in that phase </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure105.png" width="221" height="125" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 15.1</span>.

This chapter focuses on the energy costs of phases R and P. These energy costs are sometimes called the &ldquo;embodied&rdquo; or &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; energy of the stuff &ndash; slightly confusing names, since usually that energy is neither literally embodied nor embedded in the stuff. </p><h3>Drink containers</h3><p class="first">Let&rsquo;s assume you have a coke habit: you drink five cans of multinational chemicals per day, and throw the aluminium cans away. For this stuff, it&rsquo;s the raw material phase that dominates. The production of metals is energy intensive, especially for aluminium. Making one aluminium drinks-can needs 0.6 kWh. So a five-a-day habit wastes energy at a rate of <span class="red">3 kWh/d</span>. </p><p>As for a 500 ml water bottle made of PET (which weighs 25 g), the embodied energy is 0.7 kWh &ndash; just as bad as an aluminium can! </p><h3>Other packaging</h3><p class="first">The average Brit throws away 400 g of packaging per day &ndash; mainly food packaging. The embodied energy content of packaging ranges from 7 to 20 kWh per kg as we run through the spectrum from glass and paper to plastics and steel cans. Taking the typical embodied energy content to be 10 kWh/kg, we deduce that the energy footprint of packaging is <span class="red">4 kWh/d</span>. A little of this embodied energy is recoverable by waste incineration, as we&rsquo;ll discuss in Chapter 27. </p><h3>Computers</h3><p class="first">Making a personal computer costs 1800 kWh of energy. So if you buy a new computer every two years, that corresponds to a power consumption of <span class="red">2.5 kWh per day</span>. </p><h3>Batteries</h3><p class="first">The energy cost of making a rechargeable nickel-cadmium AA battery, storing 0.001 kWh of electrical energy and having a mass of 25 g, is 1.4 kWh (phases R and P). If the energy cost of disposable batteries is similar, throwing away two AA batteries per month uses about <span class="red">0.1 kWh/d</span>. The energy cost of batteries is thus likely to be a minor item in your stack of energy consumption. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure413.png" width="221" height="172" alt=""></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:14em"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure106.png" width="130" height="111" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 15.3</span>.

But there&rsquo;s talk of creating desalination plants in London. What&rsquo;s the energy cost of turning salt water into drinking water? The least energy-intensive method is reverse osmosis. Take a membrane that lets through only water, put salt water on one side of it, and pressurize the salt water. Water reluctantly oozes through the membrane, producing purer water &ndash; reluc- tantly, because pure water separated from salt has low entropy, and nature prefers high entropy states where everything is mixed up. We must pay high-grade energy to achieve unmixing. </p><p>The Island of Jersey has a desalination plant that can produce 6000 m<sup>3</sup> of pure water per day (figure 15.10). Including the pumps for bringing the water up from the sea and through a series of filters, the whole plant uses a power of 2 MW. That&rsquo;s an energy cost of 8 kWh per m<sup>3</sup> of water produced. At a cost of 8 kWh per m<sup>3</sup>, a daily water consumption of 160 litres would require <span class="red">1.3 kWh per day</span>. </p><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 15.8</span>.

Britain used to make its own gizmos, and our per-capita footprint in 1910 was as big as America&rsquo;s is today. Now Britain doesn&rsquo;t manufacture so much (so our energy consumption and carbon emissions have dropped a bit), but we still love gizmos, and we get them made for us by other countries. Should we ignore the energy cost of making the gizmo, because it&rsquo;s imported? I don&rsquo;t think so. Dieter Helm and his colleagues in Oxford estimate that under a correct account, allowing for imports and exports, Britain&rsquo;s carbon foot- print is nearly <em>doubled</em> from the official &ldquo;11 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per person&rdquo; to about 21 tons. This implies that the biggest item in the average British person&rsquo;s energy footprint is the energy cost of making imported stuff. </p><p>In Chapter H, I explore this idea further, by looking at the weight of Britain&rsquo;s imports.

The heat in the core is there because the earth used to be red-hot, and it&rsquo;s still cooling down and solidifying; the heat in the core is also being topped up by tidal friction: the earth flexes in response to the gravitational fields of the moon and sun, in the same way that an orange changes shape if you squeeze it and roll it between your hands. </p><p>Geothermal is an attractive renewable because it is &ldquo;always on,&rdquo; inde- pendent of the weather; if we make geothermal power stations, we can switch them on and off so as to follow demand. </p><p>But how much geothermal power is available? We could estimate geothermal power of two types: the power available at an ordinary location on the earth&rsquo;s crust; and the power available in special hot spots like Iceland (figure 16.3). While the right place to first develop geothermal technology is definitely the special hot spots, I&rsquo;m going to assume that the greater total resource comes from the ordinary locations, since ordinary locations are so much more numerous. </p><p>The difficulty with making <em>sustainable</em> geothermal power is that the speed at which heat travels through solid rock limits the rate at which heat can be sustainably sucked out of the red-hot interior of the earth. It&rsquo;s like trying to drink a crushed-ice drink through a straw. You stick in the straw, and suck, and you get a nice mouthful of cold liquid. But after a little more sucking, you find you&rsquo;re sucking air. You&rsquo;ve extracted all the liquid from the ice around the tip of the straw. Your initial rate of sucking wasn&rsquo;t sustainable. </p><p>If you stick a straw down a 15-km hole in the earth, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s nice and hot there, easily hot enough to boil water. So, you could stick two straws down, and pump cold water down one straw and suck from the other. You&rsquo;ll be sucking up steam, and you can run a power station. Limit- less power? No. After a while, your sucking of heat out of the rock will have reduced the temperature of the rock. You weren&rsquo;t sucking sustainably. You now have a long wait before the rock at the tip of your straws warms up again. A possible attitude to this problem is to treat geothermal heat the same way we currently treat fossil fuels: as a resource to be mined rather than collected sustainably. Living off geothermal heat in this way might be better for the planet than living unsustainably off fossil fuels; but perhaps it would only be another stop-gap giving us another 100 years of unsustainable living? In this book I&rsquo;m most interested in <em>sustainable</em> energy, as the title hinted. Let&rsquo;s do the sums. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure116.png" width="180" height="143" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 16.1</span>.

Sucking at such a rate that the rocks at the end of the our straws don&rsquo;t get colder and colder. This means sucking at the natural rate at which heat is already flowing out of the earth. </p><p>As I said before, geothermal energy comes from two sources: from radioactive decay in the crust of the earth, and from heat trickling through the mantle from the earth&rsquo;s core. In a typical continent, the heat flow from the centre coming through the mantle is about 10 mW/m<sup>2</sup>. The heat flow at the surface is 50 mW/m<sup>2</sup>. So the radioactive decay has added an extra 40 mW/m<sup>2</sup> to the heat flow from the centre. </p><p>So at a typical location, the maximum power we can get per unit area is 50 mW/m<sup>2</sup>. But that power is not high-grade power, it&rsquo;s low-grade heat that&rsquo;s trickling through at the ambient temperature up here. We presum- ably want to make electricity, and that&rsquo;s why we must drill down. Heat is useful only if it comes from a source at a higher temperature than the ambient temperature. The temperature increases with depth as shown in figure 16.4, reaching a temperature of about 500 &deg;C at a depth of 40 km. Between depths of 0 km where the heat flow is biggest but the rock tem- perature is too low, and 40 km, where the rocks are hottest but the heat flow is 5 times smaller (because we&rsquo;re missing out on all the heat generated from radioactive decay) there is an optimal depth at which we should suck. The exact optimal depth depends on what sort of sucking and power- station machinery we use. We can bound the maximum sustainable power </p><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 16.3</span>. Geothermal power in Iceland.

Under these conditions, an ideal heat engine would deliver 17 mW/m<sup>2</sup>. At the world population density of 43 people per square km, that&rsquo;s 10 kWh per person per day, if <em>all</em> land area were used. In the UK, the population density is 5 times greater, so wide-scale geothermal power of this sustainable-forever variety could offer at most <span class="green">2 kWh per person per day</span>. </p><p>This is the sustainable-forever figure, ignoring hot spots, assuming per- fect power stations, assuming every square metre of continent is exploited, and assuming that drilling is free. And that it is possible to drill 15-km deep holes. </p><h2>Geothermal power as mining</h2><p class="first">The other geothermal strategy is to treat the heat as a resource to be mined. In &ldquo;enhanced geothermal extraction&rdquo; from hot dry rocks (figure 16.5), we first drill down to a depth of 5 or 10 km, and fracture the rocks by pumping in water. (This step may create earthquakes, which don&rsquo;t go down well with the locals.) Then we drill a second well into the fracture zone. Then we pump water down one well and extract superheated water or steam from the other. This steam can be used to make electricity or to deliver heat. What&rsquo;s the hot dry rock resource of the UK? Sadly, Britain is not well endowed. Most of the hot rocks are concentrated in Cornwall, where some geothermal experiments were carried out in 1985 in a research facility at Rosemanowes, now closed.

It provides the city with a supply of hot water. The geothermal well is part of a combined heat, power, and cooling system that delivers hot and chilled water to customers, and sells electricity to the grid.

If we include the UK&rsquo;s spending on counter-terrorism and intelligence (&pound;2.5 billion per year and rising), the total for defensive activities comes to &pound;36 billion. </p><p>As a crude estimate we might guess that 6% of this &pound;36 billion is spent on energy at a cost of 2.7p per kWh. (6% is the fraction of GDP that is spent on energy, and 2.7p is the average price of energy.) That works out to about 80 TWh per year of energy going into defence: making bullets, bombs, nuc- lear weapons; making devices for delivering bullets, bombs, and nuclear weapons; and roaring around keeping in trim for the next game of good- against-evil. In our favourite units, this corresponds to <span class="red">4 kWh per day per person</span>. </p><h2>The cost of nuclear defence</h2><p class="first">The financial expenditure by the USA on manufacturing and deploying nuclear weapons from 1945 to 1996 was $5.5 trillion (in 1996 dollars). </p><p>Nuclear-weapons spending over this period exceeded the combined to- tal federal spending for education; agriculture; training, employment, and social services; natural resources and the environment; general science, space, and technology; community and regional development (including disaster relief); law enforcement; and energy production and regulation. </p><p>If again we assume that 6% of this expenditure went to energy at a cost of 5&cent; per kWh, we find that the energy cost of having nuclear weapons was 26 000 kWh per American, or <span class="red">1.4 kWh per day per American</span> (shared among 250 million Americans over 51 years). </p><p>What energy would have been delivered to the lucky recipients, had all those nuclear weapons been used? The energies of the biggest thermonu- clear weapons developed by the USA and USSR are measured in megatons of TNT. A ton of TNT is 1200 kWh.

A <em>megaton</em> bomb delivers an energy of 1.2 billion kWh. If dropped on a city of one million, a megaton bomb makes an energy donation of 1200 kWh per person, equivalent to 120 litres of petrol per person. The total energy of the USA&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal today is 2400 megatons, contained in 10 000 warheads. In the good old days when folks really took defence seriously, the arsenal&rsquo;s energy was 20 000 megatons. These bombs, if used, would have delivered an energy of about 100 000 kWh per American. That&rsquo;s equivalent to 7 kWh per day per person for a duration of 40 years &ndash; similar to all the electrical energy supplied to America by nuclear power. </p><h3>Energy cost of making nuclear materials for bombs</h3><p class="first">The main nuclear materials are plutonium, of which the USA has produced 104 t, and high-enriched uranium (HEU), of which the USA has produced 994 t. Manufacturing these materials requires energy. </p><p>The most efficient plutonium-production facilities use 24 000 kWh of heat when producing 1 gram of plutonium. So the direct energy-cost of making the USA&rsquo;s 104 tons of plutonium (1945&ndash;1996) was at least 2.5 tril- lion kWh which is 0.5 kWh per day per person (if shared between 250 million Americans). </p><p>The main energy-cost in manufacturing HEU is the cost of enrichment. Work is required to separate the <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U atoms in natural uranium in order to create a final product that is richer in <sup>235</sup>U. The USA&rsquo;s production of 994 tons of highly-enriched uranium (the USA&rsquo;s total, 1945&ndash;1996) had an energy cost of about 0.1 kWh per day per person. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Trident creates jobs.&rdquo; Well, so does relining our schools with asbestos,but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should do it! </p><p><cite>Marcus Brigstocke</cite></p></blockquote><h2>Universities</h2><p class="first">According to Times Higher Education Supplement (30 March 2007), UK universities use 5.2 billion kWh per year.

The green stack adds up to about <span class="green">180 kWh/d/p</span>. A close race! But please remember: in calculating our production stack we threw all economic, social, and environmental constraints to the wind. Also, some of our green contributors are probably incompatible with each other: our photovoltaic panels and hot-water panels would clash with each other on roofs; and our solar photovoltaic farms using 5% of the country might compete with the energy crops with which we covered 75% of the country. If we were to lose just one of our bigger green contributors &ndash; for example, if we decided that deep offshore wind is not an option, or that panelling 5% of the country with photovoltaics at a cost of &pound;200 000 per person is not on &ndash; then the production stack would no longer match the consumption stack. </p><p>Furthermore, even if our red consumption stack were lower than our green production stack, it would not necessarily mean our energy sums are adding up. You can&rsquo;t power a TV with cat food, nor can you feed a cat from a wind turbine. Energy exists in different forms &ndash; chemical, electrical, kinetic, and heat, for example. For a sustainable energy plan to add up, we need both the forms and amounts of energy consumption and production to match up. Converting energy from one form to another &ndash; from chemical to electrical, as at a fossil-fuel power station, or from electrical to chemical, as in a factory making hydrogen from water &ndash; usually involves substantial losses of useful energy. We will come back to this important detail in Chapter 27, which will describe some energy plans that do add up. </p><p>Here we&rsquo;ll reflect on our estimates of consumption and production, compare them with official averages and with other people&rsquo;s estimates, and discuss how much power renewables could plausibly deliver in a country like Britain. </p><p>The questions we&rsquo;ll address in this chapter are:</p><ol><li>Is the size of the red stack roughly correct?

The state of play after we added up all the traditional renewables.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h2>Red reflections </h2><p class="first">Our estimate of a typical affluent person&rsquo;s consumption (figure 18.1) has reached <span class="red">195 kWh per day</span>. It is indeed true that many people use this much energy, and that many more aspire to such levels of consumption. The <em>average</em> American consumes about <span class="em"><span class="red">250 kWh per day</span></span>. If we all raised our standard of consumption to an average American level, the green pro- duction stack would definitely be dwarfed by the red consumption stack. </p><p>What about the average European and the average Brit? Average Eu- ropean consumption of &ldquo;primary energy&rdquo; (which means the energy con- tained in raw fuels, plus wind and hydroelectricity) is about <span class="red">125 kWh per day per person</span>. The UK average is also <span class="red">125 kWh per day per person</span>. </p><p>These official averages do not include two energy flows. First, the &ldquo;em- bedded energy&rdquo; in <em>imported</em> stuff (the energy expended in making the stuff) is not included at all. We estimated in Chapter 15 that the embedded energy in imported stuff is at least 40 kWh/d per person. Second, the official estimates of &ldquo;primary energy consumption&rdquo; include only industrial energy flows &ndash; things like fossil fuels and hydroelectricity &ndash; and don&rsquo;t keep track of the natural embedded energy in food: energy that was originally harnessed by photosynthesis. </p><p>Another difference between the red stack we slapped together and the national total is that in most of the consumption chapters so far we tended to ignore the energy lost in converting energy from one form to another, and in transporting energy around. For example, the &ldquo;car&rdquo; estimate in Part I covered only the energy in the petrol, not the energy used at the oil refinery that makes the petrol, nor the energy used in trundling the oil and petrol from A to B. The national total accounts for all the energy, before any conversion losses. Conversion losses in fact account for about 22% of total national energy consumption. Most of these conversion losses happen at power stations. Losses in the electricity transmission network chuck away 1% of total national energy consumption. </p><p>When building our red stack, we tried to imagine how much energy a typical affluent person uses. Has this approach biased our perception of the importance of different activities? Let&rsquo;s look at some official numbers. Figure 18.2 shows the breakdown of energy consumption by end use. The top two categories are transport and heating (hot air and hot water). Those two categories also dominated the red stack in Part I. Good. </p><table class="framed" id="p104" summary=""><tr class="top"><td>Road transport</td><td>Petroleum</td><td>22.5</td></tr><tr><td>Railways</td><td>Petroleum</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>Water transport</td><td>Petroleum</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Aviation</td><td>Petroleum</td><td>7.4</td></tr><tr class="thinbottom"><td>All modes</td><td>Electricity</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td colspan="2">All energy used by transport</td><td>31.6</td></tr></table><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><img style="padding-left:2em" src="figure129.png" width="101" height="483" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 18.2</span>.

In the national averages, aviation is smaller than road transport. </p><p>How do Britain&rsquo;s official consumption figures compare with those of other countries? Figure 18.4 shows the power consumptions of lots of countries or regions, versus their gross domestic products (GDPs). There&rsquo;s an evident correlation between power consumption and GDP: the higher a country&rsquo;s GDP (per capita), the more power it consumes per capita. The UK is a fairly typical high-GDP country, surrounded by Germany, France, Japan, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, and Denmark. The only notable ex- ception to the rule &ldquo;big GDP implies big power consumption&rdquo; is Hong Kong.

Have I been mean to green? Are my numbers a load of rubbish? Have I underestimated sus- tainable production? Let&rsquo;s compare my green numbers first with several estimates found in the Sustainable Development Commission&rsquo;s publication <em>The role of nuclear power in a low carbon economy. Reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions &ndash; nuclear and the alternatives</em>. Remarkably, even though the Sustainable Development Commission&rsquo;s take on sustainable resources is very positive (&ldquo;We have huge tidal, wave, biomass and solar resources&rdquo;), <em>all the estimates in the Sustainable Development Commission&rsquo;s document are smaller than mine!</em> (To be precise, all the estimates of the renewables total are smaller thanmy total.)

It&rsquo;s been estimated that the average person&rsquo;s lifestyle consumed a power of 20 kWh per day. The wood used per person was 4 kg per day, which required 1 hectare (10 000 m<sup>2</sup>) of forest per person. The area of land per person in Europe in the 1700s was 52 000 m<sup>2</sup>. In the regions with highest population density, the area per per- son was 17 500 m<sup>2</sup> of arable land, pastures, and woods. Today the area of Britain per person is just 4000 m<sup>2</sup>, so even if we reverted to the lifestyle of the Middle Ages and completely forested the country, we could no longer live sustainably here. Our population density is far too high. </p><h2>Green ambitions meet social reality</h2><p class="first">Figure 18.1 is bleak news. Yes, technically, Britain has &ldquo;huge&rdquo; renewables. But realistically, I don&rsquo;t think Britain can live on its own renewables &ndash; at least not the way we currently live. I am partly driven to this conclusion by the chorus of opposition that greets any major renewable energy proposal. People love renewable energy, <em>unless it is bigger than a figleaf</em>.

[<span class="tinylink">uzek2</span>]. In 2006, according to DUKES, total primary energy demand was 244 million tons of oil equivalent, which corresponds to 130 kWh per day per person. I don&rsquo;t know the reason for the small difference between the UNDP number and the DUKES number, but I can explain why I chose the slightly lower number. As I mentioned on p27, DUKES uses the same energy-summing convention as me, declaring one kWh of chemical energy to be equal to one kWh of electricity. But there&rsquo;s one minor exception: DUKES defines the &ldquo;primary energy&rdquo; produced in nuclear power stations to be the thermal energy, which in 2006 was 9 kWh/d/p; this was converted (with 38% efficiency) to 3.4 kWh/d/p of supplied electricity; in my accounts, I&rsquo;ve focused on the electricity produced by hydroelectricity, other renewables, and nuclear power; this small switch in convention reduces the nuclear contribution by about 5 kWh/d/p. </p><p><span class="mark">&ndash;</span><em class="darkred">Losses in the electricity transmission network chuck away 1% of total national energy consumption</em>.

So, what are our options, if we wish to get off fossil fuels and live sustainably? We can balance the energy budget either by reducing demand, or by increasing supply, or, of course, by doing both. </p><p>Have no illusions. To achieve our goal of getting off fossil fuels, these reductions in demand and increases in supply must be <em>big</em>. Don&rsquo;t be distracted by the myth that &ldquo;every little helps.&rdquo; <em>If everyone does a little, we&rsquo;ll achieve only a little</em>. We must do a lot. What&rsquo;s required are <em>big</em> changes in demand and in supply. </p><p>&ldquo;But surely, if 60 million people all do a little, it&rsquo;ll add up to a lot?&rdquo; No. This &ldquo;if-everyone&rdquo; multiplying machine is just a way of making something small <em>sound</em> big. The &ldquo;if-everyone&rdquo; multiplying machine churns out inspirational statements of the form &ldquo;if <em>everyone</em> did X, then it would provide enough energy/water/gas to do Y,&rdquo; where Y sounds impressive. Is it surprising that Y sounds big? Of course not. We got Y by multiplying X by the number of people involved &ndash; 60 million or so! Here&rsquo;s an example from the Conservative Party&rsquo;s otherwise straight-talking <em>Blueprint for a Green Economy</em>: </p><blockquote class="fontstyle-normal"><p>&ldquo;The mobile phone charger averages around ... 1W consumption, but if every one of the country&rsquo;s 25 million mobile phones chargers were left plugged in and switched on they would consume enough electricity (219GWh) to power 66 000 homes for one year.&rdquo; </p></blockquote><p class="first">66 000? Wow, what a lot of homes! Switch off the chargers! 66 000 sounds a lot, but the sensible thing to compare it with is the total number of homes that we&rsquo;re imagining would participate in this feat of conservation, namely 25 <em>million</em> homes. 66 000 is just <em>one quarter of one percent</em> of 25 million. So while the statement quoted above is true, I think a calmer way to put it is: </p><blockquote class="fontstyle-normal"><p>If you leave your mobile phone charger plugged in, it uses <span  >one quarter of one percent</span> of your home&rsquo;s electricity.</p></blockquote><p class="first">And if everyone does it? </p><blockquote class="fontstyle-normal"><p>If <em>everyone</em> leaves their mobile phone charger plugged in, those chargers will use <span  >one quarter of one percent</span> of their homes&rsquo; electricity.</p></blockquote><p class="first">The &ldquo;if-everyone&rdquo; multiplying machine is a bad thing because it deflects people&rsquo;s attention towards 25million minnows instead of 25million sharks.

That&rsquo;s a lot. But power is a very different thing. We all use power. So to achieve a &ldquo;big difference&rdquo; in total power consumption, you need almost everyone to make a &ldquo;big&rdquo; difference to their own power consumption. </p><p>So, what&rsquo;s required are <em>big</em> changes in demand and in supply. Demand for power could be reduced in three ways: </p><ol><li>by reducing our population (figure 19.2); </li><li>by changing our lifestyle; </li><li>by keeping our lifestyle, but reducing its energy intensity through &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;technology.&rdquo; </li></ol><p class="first">Supply could be increased in three ways: </p><ol><li>We could get off fossil fuels by investing in &ldquo;clean coal&rdquo; technology. Oops! Coal is a fossil fuel. Well, never mind &ndash; let&rsquo;s take a look at this idea. If we used coal &ldquo;sustainably&rdquo; (a notion we&rsquo;ll define in a moment), how much power could it offer? If we don&rsquo;t care about sustainability and just want &ldquo;security of supply,&rdquo; could coal offer that? </li><li>We could invest in nuclear fission.

Is it at least a stop-gap that might last for 100 years? </li><li>We could buy, beg, or steal renewable energy from other countries &ndash; bearing in mind that most countries will be in the same boat as Britain and will have no renewable energy to spare; and also bearing in mind that sourcing renewable energy from another country doesn&rsquo;t magically shrink the renewable power facilities required. If we import renewable energy from other countries in order to avoid building renewable facilities the size of Wales in <em>our</em> country, someone will have to build facilities roughly the size of Wales in those other countries. </li></ol><p class="first">The next seven chapters discuss first how to reduce demand substantially, and second how to increase supply to meet that reduced, but still &ldquo;huge,&rdquo; demand.

The heating consumption of cartoon-Britain is 40 kWh per day per person (currently all supplied by fossil fuels); the transport consumption is also 40 kWh per day per person (currently all supplied by fossil fuels); and the electricity consumption is 18 kWh(e) per day per person; the electricity is currently al- most all generated from fossil fuels; the conversion of fossil-fuel energy to electricity is 40% efficient, so supplying 18 kWh(e) of electricity in today&rsquo;s cartoon-Britain requires a fossil-fuel input of 45 kWh per day per person. This simplification ignores some fairly sizeable details, such as agriculture and industry, and the embodied energy of imported goods! But I&rsquo;d like to be able to have a <em>quick</em> conversation about the main things we need to do to get off fossil fuels. Heating, transport, and electricity account for more than half of our energy consumption, so if we can come up with a plan that delivers heating, transport, and electricity sustainably, then we have made a good step on the way to a more detailed plan that adds up. </p><p>Having adopted this cartoon of Britain, our discussions of demand re- duction will have just three bits. First, how can we reduce transport&rsquo;s energy-demand and eliminate all fossil fuel use for transport? This is the topic of Chapter 20. Second, how can we reduce heating&rsquo;s energy-demand and eliminate all fossil fuel use for heating? This is the topic of Chapter 21. Third, what about electricity? Chapter 22 discusses efficiency in electricity consumption. </p><p>Three supply options &ndash; clean coal, nuclear, and other people&rsquo;s renewables &ndash; are then discussed in Chapters 23, 24, and 25. Finally, Chapter 26 discusses how to cope with fluctuations in demand and fluctuations in renewable power production. </p><p>Having laid out the demand-reducing and supply-increasing options, Chapters 27 and 28 discuss various ways to put these options together to make plans that add up, in order to supply cartoon-Britain&rsquo;s transport, heating, and electricity. </p><p>I could spend many pages discussing &ldquo;50 things you can do to make a difference,&rdquo; but I think this cartoon approach, chasing the three biggest fish, should lead to more effective policies. </p><p>But what about &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;? According to Part I, the embodied energy in imported stuff might be the biggest fish of all! Yes, perhaps that fish is the mammoth in the room. But let&rsquo;s leave defossilizing that mammoth to one side, and focus on the animals over which we have direct control. </p><p>So, here we go: let&rsquo;s talk about transport, heating, and electricity. </p><h2>For the impatient reader</h2><p class="first">Are you eager to know the end of the story right away? Here is a quick summary, a sneak preview of Part II. </p><p>First, we electrify transport. Electrification both gets transport off fossil fuels, and makes transport more energy-efficient. (Of course, electrification </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:3em"><img src="figure133.png" width="211" height="519" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 19.3</span>.

This electrification of heating further increases the amount of green electricity required. </p><p>Third, we get all the green electricity from a mix of four sources: from our own renewables; perhaps from &ldquo;clean coal;&rdquo; perhaps from nuclear; and finally, and with great politeness, from other countries&rsquo; renewables. </p><p>Among other countries&rsquo; renewables, solar power in deserts is the most plentiful option. As long as we can build peaceful international collabor- ations, solar power in other people&rsquo;s deserts certainly has the technical potential to provide us, them, and everyone with 125 kWh per day per person. </p><p>Questions?

Can <em>technology</em> deliver a reduction in consumption? In this chapter we explore options for achieving two goals: to deliver the biggest possible reduction in transport&rsquo;s energy use, <em>and</em> to eliminate fossil fuel use in transport. </p><p>Transport featured in three of our consumption chapters: Chapter 3 (cars), Chapter 5 (planes), and Chapter 15 (road freight and sea freight). So there are two sorts of transport to address: passenger transport, and freight. Our unit of passenger transport is the passenger-kilometre (p-km). If a car carries one person a distance of 100 km, it delivers 100 p-km of transportation. If it carries four people the same distance, it has delivered 400 p-km. Similarly our unit of freight transport is the ton-km (t-km). If a truck carries 5 t of cargo a distance of 100 km then it has delivered 500 t-km of freight-transport. We&rsquo;ll measure the energy consumption of passenger transport in &ldquo;kWh per 100 passenger-kilometres,&rdquo; and the energy con- sumption of freight in &ldquo;kWh per ton-km.&rdquo; Notice that these measures are the other way up compared to &ldquo;miles per gallon&rdquo;: whereas we like vehicles to deliver <em>many</em> miles per gallon, we want energy-consumption to be <em>few</em> kWh per 100 p-km. </p><p>We&rsquo;ll start this chapter by discussing how to reduce the energy con- sumption of surface transport. To understand how to reduce energy con- sumption, we need to understand where the energy is going in surface transport. Here are the three key concepts, which are explained in more detail in Technical Chapter A. </p><ol><li>In <em>short-distance travel</em> with lots of starting and stopping, the energy mainly goes into speeding up the vehicle and its contents. Key strate- gies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to <em>weigh less</em>, and to <em>go further between stops</em>. Regenerative braking, which captures energy when slowing down, may help too. In addition, it helps to <em>move slower</em>, and to <em>move less</em>. </li><li>In <em>long-distance travel</em> at steady speed, by train or automobile, most of the energy goes into making air swirl around, because you only have to accelerate the vehicle once. The key strategies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to <em>move slower</em>, and to <em>move less</em>, and to <em>use long, thin vehicles</em>. </li><li>In all forms of travel, there&rsquo;s an energy-conversion chain, which takes energy in some sort of fuel and uses some of it to push the vehicle </li></ol><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><img src="figure135.png" width="221" height="261" alt=""></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:29em"><img src="figure134.png" width="219" height="225" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.1.</span> This chapter&rsquo;s starting point: an urban luxury tractor. The average UK car has a fuel consumption of 33 miles per gallon, which corresponds to an energy consumption of <span class="mauve">80 kWh per 100 km</span>. Can we do better?</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><ol><li style="list-style-type:none">forwards. Inevitably this energy chain has inefficiencies. In a stan- dard fossil-fuel car, for example, only 25% is used for pushing, and roughly 75% of the energy is lost in making the engine and radiator hot. So a final strategy for consuming less energy is to make the energy-conversion chain more efficient. </li></ol><p>These observations lead us to six principles of vehicle design and vehi- cle use for more-efficient surface transport: <em>a)</em> reduce the frontal area per person; <em>b)</em> reduce the vehicle&rsquo;s weight per person; <em>c)</em> when travelling, go at a steady speed and avoid using brakes; <em>d)</em> travel more slowly; <em>e)</em> travel less; and <em>f)</em> make the energy chain more efficient. We&rsquo;ll now discuss a variety of ways to apply these principles. </p><h2>How to roll better</h2><p class="first">A widely quoted statistic says something along the lines of &ldquo;only <em>1 percent</em> of the energy used by a car goes into moving the driver&rdquo; &ndash; the implication being that, surely, by being a bit smarter, we could make cars <em>100</em> times more efficient? The answer is yes, almost, but only by applying the princi- ples of vehicle design and vehicle use, listed above, to <em>extreme</em> degrees. </p><p>One illustration of extreme vehicle design is an eco-car, which has small frontal area and low weight, and &ndash; if any records are to be broken &ndash; is carefully driven at a low and steady speed. The <em>Team Crocodile</em> eco-car (figure 20.2) does 2184 miles per gallon (1.3 kWh per 100 km) at a speed of 15 mph (24 km/h). Weighing 50 kg and shorter in height than a traffic cone, it comfortably accommodates one teenage driver. </p><p>Hmm. I think that the driver of the urban tractor in figure 20.1 might detect a change in &ldquo;look, feel and performance&rdquo; if we switched them to the eco-car and instructed them to keep their speed below 15 miles per hour. So, the idea that cars could easily be 100 times more energy efficient is a myth. We&rsquo;ll come back to the challenge of making energy-efficient cars in a moment. But first, let&rsquo;s see some other ways of satisfying the principles of more-efficient surface transport. </p><p>Figure 20.3 shows a multi-passenger vehicle that is at least 25 times more energy-efficient than a standard petrol car: a bicycle. The bicycle&rsquo;s performance (in terms of energy per distance) is about the same as the eco- car&rsquo;s. Its speed is the same, its mass is lower than the eco-car&rsquo;s (because the human replaces the fuel tank and engine), and its effective frontal area is higher, because the cyclist is not so well streamlined as the eco-car. </p><p>Figure 20.4 shows another possible replacement for the petrol car: a train, with an energy-cost, if full, of <span class="mauve">1.6 kWh per 100 passenger-km</span>. In contrast to the eco-car and the bicycle, trains manage to achieve outstanding efficiency without travelling slowly, and without having a low weight per person. Trains make up for their high speed and heavy frame by exploiting the principle of small frontal area per person. Whereas a cyclist </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:7em"><img src="figure137.png" width="221" height="94" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.2.</span> Team Crocodile&rsquo;s eco-car uses <span class="mauve">1.3 kWh per 100 km</span>.

The wide range of energy efficiencies of cars for sale proves this. In a single show- room in 2006 you could buy a Honda Civic 1.4 that uses roughly <span class="mauve">44 kWh per 100 km</span>, or a Honda NSX 3.2 that uses <span class="mauve">116 kWh per 100 km</span> (figure 20.9). The fact that people merrily <em>buy</em> from this wide range is also proof that we need extra incentives and legislation to encourage the blithe consumer to <em>choose</em> more energy-efficient cars. There are various ways to help con- sumers prefer the Honda Civic over the Honda NSX 3.2 gas-guzzler: raising the price of fuel; cranking up the showroom tax (the tax on new cars) in proportion to the predicted lifetime consumption of the vehicle; cranking up the road-tax on gas guzzlers; parking privileges for economical cars (figure 20.10); or fuel rationing. All such measures are unpopular with at least some voters. Perhaps a better legislative tactic would be to <em>enforce</em> rea- sonable energy-efficiency, rather than continuing to allow unconstrained choice; for example, we could simply <em>ban</em>, from a certain date, the sale of <em>any</em> car whose energy consumption is more than 80 kWh per 100 km; and then, over time, reduce this ceiling to 60 kWh per 100 km, then 40 kWh per 100 km, and beyond. Alternatively, to give the consumer more choice, regulations could force car manufacturers to reduce the <em>average</em> energy consumption of all the cars they sell. Additional legislation limiting the weight and frontal area of vehicles would simultaneously reduce fuel con- sumption and improve safety for other road-users (figure 20.11). People today choose their cars to make fashion statements. With strong efficiency legislation, there could still be a wide choice of fashions; they&rsquo;d all just happen to be energy-efficient. You could choose any colour, as long as it was green. </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.9</span>.

Lyon&rsquo;s population of 470 000 inhabitants is served by 2000 bikes distributed around 175 cycle-stations in an area of 50 km<sup>2</sup> (figure 20.15). In the city centre, you&rsquo;re usually within 400 metres of a cycle-station. Users join the scheme by paying a subscription fee of &euro;10 per year and may then hire bicycles free for all trips lasting less than 30 minutes. For longer hire periods, users pay up to &euro;1 per hour. Short-term visitors to Lyon can buy one-week subscriptions for &euro;1. </p><h3>Other legislative opportunities</h3><p class="first">Speed limits are a simple knob that could be twiddled. As a rule, cars that travel slower use less energy (see Chapter A). With practice, drivers can learn to drive more economically: using the accelerator and brake less and always driving in the highest possible gear can give a 20% reduction in fuel consumption. </p><p>Another way to reduce fuel consumption is to reduce congestion. Stop- ping and starting, speeding up and slowing down, is a much less efficient way to get around than driving smoothly. Idling in stationary traffic is an especially poor deliverer of miles per gallon! </p><p>Congestion occurs when there are too many vehicles on the roads. So one simple way to reduce congestion is to group travellers into fewer ve- hicles. A striking way to think about a switch from cars to coaches is to calculate the road area required by the two modes. Take a trunk road on the verge of congestion, where the desired speed is 60 mph. The safe dis- tance from one car to the next at 60 mph is 77 m. If we assume there&rsquo;s one car every 80 m and that each car contains 1.6 people, then vacuuming up 40 people into a single coach frees up <em>two kilometres</em> of road! </p><p>Congestion can be reduced by providing good alternatives (cycle lanes, public transport), and by charging road users extra if they contribute to congestion. In this chapter&rsquo;s notes I describe a fair and simple method for handling congestion-charging. </p><h2>Enhancing cars</h2><p class="first">Assuming that the developed world&rsquo;s love-affair with the car is not about to be broken off, what are the technologies that can deliver significant en- ergy savings? Savings of 10% or 20% are easy &ndash; we&rsquo;ve already discussed some ways to achieve them, such as making cars smaller and lighter. Another option is to switch from petrol to diesel. Diesel engines are more expensive to make, but they tend to be more fuel-efficient. But are there technologies that can radically increase the efficiency of the energy-conversion chain? (Recall that in a standard petrol car, 75% of the energy is turned </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><img src="figure148.png" width="219" height="194" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.15</span>.

And what about the goal of getting off fossil fuels? </p><p>In this section, we&rsquo;ll discuss five technologies: regenerative braking; hybrid cars; electric cars; hydrogen-powered cars; and compressed-air cars. </p><h3>Regenerative braking</h3><p class="first">There are four ways to capture energy as a vehicle slows down.</p><ol><li>An electric generator coupled to the wheels can charge up an electric battery or supercapacitor.</li><li>Hydraulic motors driven by the wheels can make compressed air, stored in a small canister.</li><li>Energy can be stored in a flywheel.</li><li>Braking energy can be stored as gravitational energy by driving the vehicle up a ramp whenever you want to slow down. This gravitational energy storage option is rather inflexible, since there must be a ramp in the right place. It&rsquo;s an option that&rsquo;s most useful for trains, and it is illustrated by the London Underground&rsquo;s Victoria line, which has hump-back stations. Each station is at the top of a hill in the track. Arriving trains are automatically slowed down by the hill, and departing trains are accelerated as they go down the far side of the hill. The hump-back-station design provides an energy saving of 5% and makes the trains run 9% faster. </li></ol><p class="first">Electric regenerative braking (using a battery to store the energy) salvages roughly 50% of the car&rsquo;s energy in a braking event, leading to perhaps a 20% reduction in the energy cost of city driving. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.17</span>. A BMW 530i modified by Artemis Intelligent Power to use digital hydraulics. Lower left: A 6-litre accumulator (the red canister), capable of storing about 0.05 kWh of energy in compressed nitrogen. Lower right: Two 200 kW hydraulic motors, one for each rear wheel, which both accelerate and decelerate the car. The car is still powered by its standard 190 kW petrol engine, but thanks to the digital hydraulic transmission and regenerative braking, it uses 30% less fuel.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p>Regenerative systems using flywheels and hydraulics seem to work a little better than battery-based systems, salvaging at least 70% of the brak- ing energy. Figure 20.17 describes a hybrid car with a petrol engine powering digitally-controlled hydraulics. On a standard driving cycle, this car uses 30% less fuel than the original petrol car. In urban driving, its energy consumption is halved, from <span class="mauve">131 kWh per 100 km</span> to <span class="mauve">62 kWh per 100 km</span> (20 mpg to 43 mpg). (Credit for this performance improvement must be shared between regenerative braking and the use of hybrid technology.) Hydraulics and flywheels are both promising ways to handle regenerative braking because small systems can handle large powers. A flywheel system weighing just 24 kg (figure 20.18), designed for energy storage in a racing car, can store 400 kJ (0.1 kWh) of energy &ndash; enough energy to acceler- ate an ordinary car up to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h); and it can accept or deliver 60 kW of power. Electric batteries capable of delivering that much power would weigh about 200 kg. So, unless you&rsquo;re already carrying that much battery on board, an electrical regenerative-braking system should probably use capacitors to store braking energy. Super-capacitors have similar energy-storage and power-delivery parameters to the flywheel&rsquo;s. </p><h3>Hybrid cars</h3><p class="first">Hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius (figure 20.19) have more-efficient engines and electric regenerative braking, but to be honest, today&rsquo;s hybrid vehicles don&rsquo;t really stand out from the crowd (figure 20.9). </p><p>The horizontal bars in figure 20.9 highlight a few cars including two hybrids. Whereas the average new car in the UK emits 168 g, the hybrid Prius emits about 100 g of CO<sub>2</sub> per km, as do several other non-hybrid vehicles &ndash; the VW Polo blue motion emits 99 g/km, and there&rsquo;s a Smart car that emits 88 g/km. </p><p>The Lexus RX 400h is the second hybrid, advertised with the slogan &ldquo;LOW POLLUTION. ZERO GUILT.&rdquo; But its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are 192 g/km &ndash; worse than the average UK car! The advertising standards authority ruled that this advertisement breached the advertising codes on Truthfulness, Comparisons and Environmental claims. &ldquo;We considered that ... readers were likely to understand that the car caused little or no harm to the envir- onment, which was not the case, and had low emissions in comparison with all cars, which was also not the case.&rdquo; </p><p>In practice, hybrid technologies seem to give fuel savings of 20 or 30%. So neither these petrol/electric hybrids, nor the petrol/hydraulic hybrid featured in figure 20.17 seems to me to have really cracked the transport challenge. A 30% reduction in fossil-fuel consumption is impressive, but it&rsquo;s not enough by this book&rsquo;s standards. Our opening assumption was that we want to get off fossil fuels, or at least to reduce fossil fuel use by 90%. Can this goal be achieved without reverting to bicycles? </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure152.png" width="216" height="248" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.18</span>.

The G-Wiz&rsquo;s electric motor has a peak power of 13 kW, and can produce a sustained power of 4.8 kW. The motor provides regenerative braking. It is powered by eight 6-volt lead acid batteries, which when fully charged give a range of &ldquo;up to 77 km.&rdquo; A full charge consumes 9.7 kWh of electricity. These figures imply a transport cost of 13 kWh per 100 km. </p><p>Manufacturers always quote the best possible performance of their products. What happens in real life? The real-life performance of a G-Wiz in London is shown in figure 20.21. Over the course of 19 recharges, the average transport cost of this G-Wiz is <span class="mauve">21 kWh per 100 km</span> &ndash; about four times better than an average fossil fuel car. The best result was 16 kWh per 100 km, and the worst was 33 kWh per 100 km. If you are interested in carbon emissions, 21 kWh per 100 km is equivalent to 105 g CO<sub>2</sub> per km, assuming that electricity has a footprint of 500 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh. </p><p>Now, the G-Wiz sits at one end of the performance spectrum. What if we demand more &ndash; more acceleration, more speed, and more range? At the other end of the spectrum is the Tesla Roadster. The Tesla Roadster 2008 has a range of 220 miles (354 km); its lithium-ion battery pack stores 53 kWh and weighs 450 kg (120 Wh/kg). The vehicle weighs 1220 kg and its motor&rsquo;s maximum power is 185 kW. What is the energy-consumption of this muscle car? Remarkably, it&rsquo;s better than the G-Wiz: <span class="mauve">15 kWh per 100 km</span>. Evidence that a range of 354 km should be enough for most people most of the time comes from the fact that only 8.3% of commuters travel more than 30 km to their workplace. </p><p>I&rsquo;ve looked up the performance figures for lots of electric vehicles &ndash; they&rsquo;re listed in this chapter&rsquo;s end-notes &ndash; and they seem to be consistent with this summary: electric vehicles can deliver transport at an energy cost of roughly <span class="mauve">15 kWh per 100 km</span>. That&rsquo;s five times better than our baseline fossil-car, and significantly better than any hybrid cars. Hurray! To achieve economical transport, we don&rsquo;t have to huddle together in public transport &ndash; we can still hurtle around, enjoying all the pleasures and freedoms of solo travel, thanks to electric vehicles. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:11em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.20</span>.

But are there any other options crossing the finishing line? We have yet to hear about the compressed-air-powered car and the hydrogen car. If either of these turns out to be better than electric car, it won&rsquo;t affect the long-term picture very much: whichever of these three technologies we went for, the vehicles would be charged up using energy generated from a &ldquo;green&rdquo; source. </p><h3>Compressed-air cars</h3><p class="first">Air-powered vehicles are not a new idea. Hundreds of trams powered by compressed air and hot water plied the streets of Nantes and Paris from 1879 to 1911. Figure 20.24 shows a German pneumatic locomotive from 1958. I think that in terms of energy efficiency the compressed-air tech- nique for storing energy isn&rsquo;t as good as electric batteries. The problem is that compressing the air generates <em>heat</em> that&rsquo;s unlikely to be used efficiently; and expanding the air generates <em>cold</em>, another by-product that is unlikely to be used efficiently. But compressed air may be a superior technology to electric batteries in other ways. For example, air can be compressed thous- ands of times and doesn&rsquo;t wear out! It&rsquo;s interesting to note, however, that the first product sold by the Aircar company is actually an <em>electric</em> scooter. [<span class="websitetitle">www.theaircar.com/acf</span>] </p><p>There&rsquo;s talk of Tata Motors in India manufacturing air-cars, but it&rsquo;s hard to be sure whether the compressed-air vehicle is going to see a revival, because no-one has published the specifications of any modern prototypes. Here&rsquo;s the fundamental limitation: the energy-density of compressed-air energy-stores is only about 11&ndash;28 Wh per kg, which is similar to lead-acid batteries, and roughly five times smaller than lithium-ion batteries. (See figure 26.13, p199, for details of other storage technologies.) So the range of a compressed-air car will only ever be as good as the range of the earliest electric cars. Compressed-air storage systems do have three advantages over batteries: longer life, cheaper construction, and fewer nasty chemicals. </p><h3>Hydrogen cars &ndash; blimp your ride</h3><p class="first">I think hydrogen is a hyped-up bandwagon. I&rsquo;ll be delighted to be proved wrong, but I don&rsquo;t see how hydrogen is going to help us with our energy problems. Hydrogen is not a miraculous <em>source</em> of energy; it&rsquo;s just an en- ergy <em>carrier</em>, like a rechargeable battery. And it is a rather inefficient energy carrier, with a whole bunch of practical defects. </p><p>The &ldquo;hydrogen economy&rdquo; received support from <em>Nature</em> magazine in </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure154.png" width="219" height="308" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.24</span>.

Nature&rsquo;s article lauded Arnold&rsquo;s vision of hydrogen-powered cars replacing &ldquo;polluting models&rdquo; with the quote &ldquo;the governor is a real-life climate action hero.&rdquo; But the critical question that needs to be asked when such hydrogen heroism is on display is &ldquo;where is the <em>energy</em> to come from to <em>make</em> the hydrogen?&rdquo; Moreover, converting energy to and from hydrogen can only be done inef- ficiently &ndash; at least, with today&rsquo;s technology. </p><p>Here are some numbers.</p><ul><li>In the CUTE (Clean Urban Transport for Europe) project, which was intended to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of fuelcell buses and hydrogen technology, fuelling the hydrogen buses required between 80% and 200% <em>more</em> energy than the baseline diesel bus. </li><li>Fuelling the <em>Hydrogen 7</em>, the hydrogen-powered car made by BMW, requires <span class="mauve">254 kWh per 100 km</span> &ndash; <em>220% more</em> energy than an average European car. </li></ul><p class="first">If our task were &ldquo;please stop using fossil fuels for transport, allowing your- self the assumption that <em>infinite</em> quantities of green electricity are available for free,&rdquo; then of course an energy-profligate transport solution like hy- drogen might be a contender (though hydrogen faces other problems). But <em>green electricity is not free</em>. Indeed, getting green electricity on the scale of our current consumption is going to be very challenging. The fossil fuel challenge is an energy challenge. The climate-change problem is an energy problem. We need to focus on solutions that use less energy, not &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; that use more! <em>I know of no form of land transport whose energy consumption is worse than this hydrogen car</em>. (The only transport methods I know that are worse are jet-skis &ndash; using about <span class="mauve">500 kWh per 100 km</span> &ndash; and the <em>Earthrace</em> biodiesel-powered speed-boat, absurdly called an eco-boat, which uses <span class="mauve">800 kWh per 100 p-km</span>.) </p><p>Hydrogen advocates may say &ldquo;the BMW Hydrogen 7 is just an early prototype, and it&rsquo;s a luxury car with lots of muscle &ndash; the technology is going to get more efficient.&rdquo; Well, I hope so, because it has a lot of catching up to do. The Tesla Roadster (figure 20.22) is an early prototype too, and it&rsquo;s also a luxury car with lots of muscle. And it&rsquo;s more than ten times more energy-efficient than the Hydrogen 7! Feel free to put your money on the hydrogen horse if you want, and if it wins in the end, fine. But it seems daft to back the horse that&rsquo;s so far behind in the race. Just look at figure 20.23 &ndash; if I hadn&rsquo;t squished the top of the vertical axis, the hydrogen car would not have fitted on the page! </p><p>Yes, the Honda fuel-cell car, the FCX Clarity, does better &ndash; it rolls in at 69 kWh per 100 km &ndash; but my prediction is that after all the &ldquo;zero- emissions&rdquo; trumpeting is over, we&rsquo;ll find that hydrogen cars use just as much energy as the average fossil car of today. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:5em"><img src="figure156.png" width="219" height="158" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.26</span>.

Hydrogen is a less convenient energy storage medium than most liquid fuels, because of its bulk, whether stored as a high pressure gas or as a liquid (which requires a temperature of -253 &deg;C). Even at a pressure of 700 bar (which requires a hefty pressure vessel) its energy density (energy per unit volume) is 22% of gasoline&rsquo;s. The cryogenic tank of the BMW Hydrogen 7 weighs 120 kg and stores 8 kg of hydrogen. Furthermore, hydrogen gradually leaks out of any practical container.<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#131><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> If you park your hydrogen car at the railway station with a full tank and come back a week later, you should expect to find most of the hydrogen has gone.<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#131><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> </p><h3>Some questions about electric vehicles</h3><h4>You&rsquo;ve shown that electric cars are more energy-efficient than fossil cars. But are they better if our objective is to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the electricity is still generated by fossil power- stations?</h4><p>This is quite an easy calculation to do. Assume the electric vehicle&rsquo;s energy cost is 20 kWh(e) per 100 km. (I think 15 kWh(e) per 100 km is perfectly possible, but let&rsquo;s play sceptical in this calculation.) If grid electricity has a carbon footprint of 500 g per kWh(e) then the effective emissions of this vehicle are <strong>100 g CO<sub>2</sub> per km</strong>, which is as good as the best fossil cars (figure 20.9). So I conclude that switching to electric cars is <em>already</em> a good idea, even before we green our electricity supply. </p><h4>Electric cars, like fossil cars, have costs of both manufacture and use. Electric cars may cost less to use, but if the batteries don&rsquo;t last very long, shouldn&rsquo;t you pay more attention to the manufacturing cost?</h4><p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a good point. My transport diagram shows only the use cost. If electric cars require new batteries every few years, my numbers may be underestimates. The batteries in a Prius are expected to last just 10 years, and a new set would cost &pound;3500. Will anyone want to own a 10-year old Prius and pay that cost? It could be predicted that most Priuses will be junked at age 10 years. This is certainly a concern for all electric vehicles that have batteries. I guess I&rsquo;m optimistic that, as we switch to electric vehicles, battery technology is going to improve. </p><h4>I live in a hot place. How could I drive an electric car? I demand power-hungry air-conditioning! </h4><p>There&rsquo;s an elegant fix for this demand: fit 4 m<sup>2</sup> of photovoltaic panels in the upward-facing surfaces of the electric car. If the air-conditioning is needed, the sun must surely be shining. 20%-efficient panels will generate up to 800 W, which is enough to power a car&rsquo;s air-conditioning. The panels might even make a useful contribution to charging the car when it&rsquo;s parked, too. Solar-powered vehicle cooling was included in a Mazda in 1993; the solar cells were embedded in the glass sunroof. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h4>I live in a cold place. How could I drive an electric car? I demand power-hungry heating! </h4><p>The motor of an electric vehicle, when it&rsquo;s running, will on average use something like 10 kW, with an efficiency of 90&ndash;95%. Some of the lost power, the other 5&ndash;10%, will be dissipated as heat in the motor. Perhaps electric cars that are going to be used in cold places can be carefully designed so that this motor-generated heat, which might amount to 250 or 500 W, can be piped from the motor into the car. That much power would provide some significant windscreen demisting or body-warming. </p><h4>Are lithium-ion batteries safe in an accident?</h4><p>Some lithium-ion batteries are unsafe when short-circuited or overheated, but the battery industry is now producing safer batteries such as lithium phosphate. There&rsquo;s a fun safety video at <span class="websitetitle">www.valence.com</span>. </p><h4>Is there enough lithium to make all the batteries for a huge fleet of electric cars? </h4><p>World lithium reserves are estimated to be 9.5 million tons in ore deposits (p175). A lithium-ion battery is 3% lithium. If we assume each vehicle has a 200 kg battery, then we need 6 kg of lithium per vehicle. So the estimated reserves in ore deposits are enough to make the batteries for 1.6 billion vehicles. That&rsquo;s more than the number of cars in the world today (roughly 1 billion) &ndash; but not much more, so the amount of lithium may be a concern, especially when we take into account the competing ambitions of the nuclear fusion posse (Chapter 24) to guzzle lithium in their reactors. There&rsquo;s many thousands times more lithium in sea water, so perhaps the oceans will provide a useful backup. However, lithium specialist R. Keith Evans says &ldquo;concerns regarding lithium availability for hybrid or electric vehicle batteries or other foreseeable applications are unfounded.&rdquo; And anyway, other lithium-free battery technologies such as zinc-air recharge- ables are being developed [<span class="websitetitle">www.revolttechnology.com</span>]. I think the elec- tric car is a goer! </p><h2>The future of flying?</h2><p class="first">The superjumbo A380 is said by Airbus to be &ldquo;a highly fuel-efficient air- craft.&rdquo; In fact, it burns just 12% less fuel per passenger than a 747. </p><p>Boeing has announced similar breakthroughs: their new 747&ndash;8 Inter- continental, trumpeted for its planet-saving properties, is (according to Boeing&rsquo;s advertisements) only 15% more fuel-efficient than a 747&ndash;400. </p><p>This slender rate of progress (contrasted with cars, where changes in technology deliver two-fold or even ten-fold improvements in efficiency) is explained in Technical Chapter C.

Then I looked at the numbers. The sad truth is that ocean liners use more energy per passenger-km than jumbo jets. The QE2 uses four times as much energy per passenger-km as a jumbo. OK, it&rsquo;s a luxury vessel; can we do better with slower tourist-class liners? From 1952 to 1968, the eco- nomical way to cross the Atlantic was in two Dutch-built liners known as &ldquo;The Economy Twins,&rdquo; the Maasdam and the Rijnsdam<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#133><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a>. These travelled at 16.5 knots (30.5 km/h), so the crossing from Britain to New York took eight days. Their energy consumption, if they carried a full load of 893 passengers, was 103 kWh per 100 p-km. At a typical 85% occupancy, the energy consumption was <span class="mauve">121 kWh per 100 pkm</span> &ndash; more than twice that of the jumbo jet. To be fair to the boats, they are not only providing trans- portation: they also provide the passengers and crew with hot air, hot water, light, and entertainment for several days; but the energy saved back home from being cooped up on the boat is dwarfed by the boat&rsquo;s energy consumption, which, in the case of the QE2, is about 3000 kWh per day per passenger. </p><p>So, sadly, I don&rsquo;t think boats are going to beat planes in energy con- sumption. If eventually we want a way of travelling large distances without fossil fuels, perhaps nuclear-powered ships are an interesting option (figures 20.31 &amp; 20.32). </p> <h2>What about freight?</h2><p class="first">International shipping is a surprisingly efficient user of fossil fuels; so get- ting road transport off fossil fuels is a higher priority than getting ships off fossil fuels. But fossil fuels are a finite resource, and eventually ships must be powered by something else. Biofuels <em>may</em> work out. Another option will be nuclear power. The first nuclear-powered ship for carrying cargo and passengers was the NS Savannah, launched in 1962 as part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower&rsquo;s <em>Atoms for Peace</em> initiative (figure 20.31). Powered by one 74-MW nuclear reactor driving a 15-MW motor, the Sa- vannah had a service speed of 21 knots (39 km/h) and could carry 60 pas- sengers and 14000 t of cargo. That&rsquo;s a cargo transport cost of 0.14 kWh per ton-km. She could travel 500 000 km without refuelling. There are already many nuclear-powered ships, both military and civilian. Russia has ten nuclear-powered ice-breakers, for example, of which seven are still active. Figure 20.32 shows the nuclear ice-breaker Yamal, which has two 171-MW reactors, and motors that can deliver 55 MW. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure160.png" width="219" height="172" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 20.30</span>.

I learnt a brilliant way to automate congestion-charging from Stephen Salter. A simple daily congestion charge, as levied in London, sends only a crude signal to drivers; once a car-owner has decided to pay the day&rsquo;s charge and drive into a congestion zone, he has no incentive to drive <em>little</em> in the zone. Nor is he rewarded with any rebate if he carefully chooses routes in the zone that are not congested. Instead of having a centralized authority that decides in advance when and where the congestion-charge zones are, with expensive and intrusive monitoring and recording of vehicle movements into and within all those zones, Salter has a simpler, decentralized, anonymous method of charging drivers for driving in heavy, slow traffic, wherever and whenever it actually exists. The system would operate nationwide. Here&rsquo;s how it works. We want a device that answers the question &ldquo;how congested is the traffic I am driving in?&rdquo; A good measure of congestion is &ldquo;how many other active vehicles are close to mine?&rdquo; In fast-moving traffic, the spacing between vehicles is larger than slow-moving traffic.

The congestion charge would be proportional to the number of bleeps received; this charge could be paid at refuelling stations whenever the vehicle is refuelled.

How about heating?

My house is a three-bedroom semi-detached house built about 1940 (figure 21.1). The <span class="mauve">average temperature difference</span> between the inside and outside of the house depends on the setting of the thermostat and on the weather. If the thermostat is permanently at 20 &deg;C, the average temperature difference might be <span class="mauve">9 &deg;C</span>. The <span class="darkblue"><em>leakiness</em> of the building</span> describes how quickly heat gets out through walls, windows, and cracks, in response to a temperature difference. The leakiness is sometimes called the <em>heat-loss coefficient</em> of the building. It is measured in kWh per day per degree of temperature difference. In Chapter E, I calculate that the leakiness of my house in 2006 was 7.7 kWh/d/&deg;C. The product </p><p class="centrespaced"><span class="mauve">average temperature difference</span> &times; <span class="darkblue">leakiness of building</span> </p><p class="first">is the rate at which heat flows out of the house by conduction and ventilation.

It&rsquo;s bigger for two reasons: first, this formula assumes that all the heat is supplied by the boiler, whereas in fact some heat is supplied by incidental heat gains from occupants, gadgets, and the sun; second, in Chapter 7 we assumed that a person kept just two rooms at 20 &deg;C all the time; keeping an entire house at this temperature all the time would require more. </p><p>OK, how can we reduce the power used by heating? Well, obviously, there are three lines of attack. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure174.png" width="219" height="289" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.1</span>.

You turn it down, and your building uses less energy. Magic! In Britain, for every degree that you turn the thermostat down, the heat loss decreases by about 10%. Turning the ther- mostat down from 20 &deg;C to 15 &deg;C would nearly halve the heat loss. Thanks to incidental heat gains by the building, the savings in heating power will be even bigger than these reductions in heat loss. </p><p>Unfortunately, however, this remarkable energy-saving technology has side-effects. Some humans call turning the thermostat down a lifestyle change, and are not happy with it. I&rsquo;ll make some suggestions later about how to sidestep this lifestyle issue. Meanwhile, as proof that &ldquo;the most important smart component in a building with smart heating is the occupant,&rdquo; figure 21.2 shows data from a Carbon Trust study, observing the heat consumption in twelve identical modern houses. This study permits us to gawp at the family at number 1, whose heat consumption is twice as big as that of Mr. and Mrs. Woolly at number 12. However, we should pay attention to the numbers: the family at number 1 are using 43 kWh per day. But if this is shocking, hang on &ndash; a moment ago, didn&rsquo;t I estimate that <em>my</em> house might use more than that? Indeed, my average gas consumption from 1993 to 2003 was a little more than 43 kWh per day (fi- gure 7.10, p53), and I thought I was a frugal person! The problem is the <em>house</em>. All the modern houses in the Carbon Trust study had a leakiness of <span class="darblue">2.7 kWh/d/&deg;C</span>, but my house had a leakiness of <span class="darkblue">7.7 kWh/d/&deg;C</span>!

Adding loft insulation and cavity-wall insul- ation reduces heat loss in a typical old house by about 25%. Thanks to incidental heat gains, this 25% reduction in heat loss translates into roughly a 40% reduction in heating consumption. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s put these ideas to the test. </p><h2>A case study</h2><p class="first">I introduced you to my house on page 53. Let&rsquo;s pick up the story. In 2004 I had a condensing boiler installed, replacing the old gas boiler. (Condensing boilers use a heat-exchanger to transfer heat from the exhaust gases to incoming air.) At the same time I removed the house&rsquo;s hot-water tank (so hot water is now made only on demand), and I put thermostats on all the bedroom radiators. Along with the new condensing boiler came a </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.3</span>.

But that question presumes that we have to fix the light level; and we don&rsquo;t have to. We can fit light switches that the reader can turn on, and that switch themselves off again after an appropriate time. Similarly, thermostats don&rsquo;t need to be left up at 20 &deg;C all the time. </p><p>Before leaving the topic of thermostat settings, I should mention air- conditioning. Doesn&rsquo;t it drive you crazy to go into a building in summer where the thermostat of the air-conditioning is set to 18 &deg;C? These loony building managers are subjecting everyone to temperatures that in winter- time they would whinge are too cold! In Japan, the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cool- Biz&rdquo; guidelines recommend that air-conditioning be set to 28 &deg;C (82 F). </p><h2>Better buildings</h2><p class="first">If you get the chance to build a new building then there are lots of ways to ensure its heating consumption is much smaller than that of an old building. Figure 21.2 gave evidence that modern houses are built to much better insulation standards than those of the 1940s. But the building standards in Britain could be still better, as Chapter E discusses. The three key ideas for the best results are: (1) have really thick insulation in floors, walls, and roofs; (2) ensure the building is completely sealed and use active ventilation to introduce fresh air and remove stale and humid air, with heat exchangers passively recovering much of the heat from the removed air; (3) design the building to exploit sunshine as much as possible. </p><h2>The energy cost of heat</h2><p class="first">So far, this chapter has focused on temperature control and leakiness. Now we turn to the third factor in the equation: </p><table class="fraction" summary=""><tr><td rowspan="2"><span class="red">power used</span></td><td rowspan="2">=</td><td><span class="mauve">average temperature difference</span> &times; <span class="darkblue">leakiness of building</span></td></tr><tr><td class="upper_line"><span class="green">efficiency of heating system</span></td></tr></table><p class="first">How efficiently can heat be produced? Can we obtain heat on the cheap? Today, building-heating in Britain is primarily delivered by burning a fossil fuel, natural gas, in boilers with efficiencies of 78%&ndash;90%. Can we get off fossil fuels at the same time as making building-heating more efficient? </p><p>One technology that is held up as an answer to Britain&rsquo;s heating problem is called &ldquo;combined heat and power&rdquo; (CHP), or its cousin, &ldquo;micro- CHP.&rdquo; I will explain combined heat and power now, but I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s a bad idea, because there&rsquo;s a better technology for heat- ing, called heat pumps, which I&rsquo;ll describe in a few pages. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:20em"><img src="figure184.png" width="216" height="405" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.7</span>. Eggborough. Not a power station participating in smart heating.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img src="figure180.png" width="379" height="264" alt=""><h3>Combined heat and power</h3><p class="first">The standard view of conventional big centralised power stations is that they are terribly inefficient, chucking heat willy-nilly up chimneys and cooling towers. A more sophisticated view recognizes that to turn thermal energy into electricity, we inevitably have to dump heat in a cold place (figure 21.8). That is how heat engines work. There <em>has</em> to be a cold place. But surely, it&rsquo;s argued, we could use <em>buildings</em> as the dumping place for this &ldquo;waste&rdquo; heat instead of cooling towers or sea water? This idea is called &ldquo;combined heat and power&rdquo; (CHP) or cogeneration, and it&rsquo;s been widely used in continental Europe for decades &ndash; in many cities, a big power station is integrated with a district heating system. Proponents of the modern incarnation of combined heat and power, &ldquo;micro-CHP,&rdquo; suggest that tiny power stations should be created within single buildings or small collections of buildings, delivering heat and electricity to those buildings, and exporting some electricity to the grid. </p><img style="padding: 1em 0 1em 2em" src="figure181.png" width="372" height="90" alt=""><p>There&rsquo;s certainly some truth in the view that Britain is rather backward when it comes to district heating and combined heat and power, but dis- cussion is hampered by a general lack of numbers, and by two particular errors. First, when comparing different ways of using fuel, the wrong mea- sure of &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; is used, namely one that weights electricity as having equal value to heat. The truth is, electricity is more valuable than heat. Second, it&rsquo;s widely assumed that the &ldquo;waste&rdquo; heat in a traditional power </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.8</span>. How a power station works. There has to be a cold place to condense the steam to make the turbine go round.

District heating absorbs heat that would have been chucked up a cooling tower.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img style="padding-bottom: 2em" src="figure182.png" width="628" height="244" alt=""><p class="first">station could be captured for a useful purpose <em>without impairing the power station&rsquo;s electricity production</em>. This sadly is not true, as the numbers will show. Delivering useful heat to a customer always reduces the electricity produced to some degree. The true net gains from combined heat and power are often much smaller than the hype would lead you to believe. </p><p>A final impediment to rational discussion of combined heat and power is a myth that has grown up recently, that decentralizing a technology somehow makes it greener. So whereas big centralized fossil fuel power stations are &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; flocks of local micro-power stations are imbued with goodness. But if decentralization is actually a good idea then &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo; should be evident in the numbers. Decentralization should be able to stand on its own two feet. And what the numbers actually show is that <em>centralized</em> electricity generation has many benefits in both economic and energy terms. Only in large buildings is there any benefit to local generation, and usually that benefit is only about 10% or 20%. </p><p>The government has a target for growth of combined heat and power to 10 GW of electrical capacity by 2010, but I think that growth of gas- powered combined heat and power would be a mistake. Such combined heat and power is not green: it uses fossil fuel, and it locks us into continued use of fossil fuel. Given that heat pumps are a better technology, I believe we should leapfrog over gas-powered combined heat and power and go directly for heat pumps. </p><h3>Heat pumps</h3><p class="first">Like district heating and combined heat and power, heat pumps are already widely used in continental Europe, but strangely rare in Britain. Heat pumps are back-to-front refrigerators. Feel the back of your refrigerator: it&rsquo;s <em>warm</em>. A refrigerator moves heat from one place (its inside) to </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:17em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.10</span>. Heat pumps.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">another (its back panel). So one way to heat a building is to turn a refrig- erator inside-out &ndash; put the <em>inside</em> of the refrigerator in the garden, thus cooling the garden down; and leave the back panel of the refrigerator in your kitchen, thus warming the house up. What isn&rsquo;t obvious about this whacky idea is that it is a really efficient way to warm your house. For every kilowatt of power drawn from the electricity grid, the back-to-front refrigerator can pump three kilowatts of heat from the garden, so that a total of four kilowatts of heat gets into your house. So heat pumps are roughly four times as efficient as a standard electrical bar-fire. Whereas the bar-fire&rsquo;s efficiency is 100%, the heat pump&rsquo;s is 400%. The efficiency of a heat pump is usually called its <em>coefficient of performance</em> or CoP. If the efficiency is 400%, the coefficient of performance is 4. </p><p>Heat pumps can be configured in various ways (figure 21.10). A heat pump can cool down the <em>air</em> in your garden using a heat-exchanger (typ- ically a 1-metre tall white box, figure 21.11), in which case it&rsquo;s called an air-source heat pump. Alternatively, the pump may cool down the <em>ground</em> using big loops of underground plumbing (many tens of metres long), in which case it&rsquo;s called a ground-source heat pump. Heat can also be pumped from rivers and lakes. </p><p>Some heat pumps can pump heat in either direction. When an airsource heat pump runs in reverse, it uses electricity to warm up the <em>outside</em> air and cool down the air <em>inside</em> your building. This is called air-condition- ing. Many air-conditioners are indeed heat-pumps working in precisely this way. Ground-source heat pumps can also work as air-con- ditioners. So a single piece of hardware can be used to provide winter heating and summer cooling. </p><p>People sometimes say that ground-source heat pumps use &ldquo;geothermal energy,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not the right name. As we saw in Chapter 16, geothermal energy offers only a tiny trickle of power per unit area (about 50 mW/m<sup>2</sup>), in most parts of the world; heat pumps have nothing to do with this trickle, and they can be used both for heating and for cooling. Heat pumps simply use the ground as a place to suck heat from, or to dump heat into. When they steadily suck heat, that heat is actually being replenished by warmth from the sun. </p><p>There&rsquo;s two things left to do in this chapter. We need to compare heat pumps with combined heat and power. Then we need to discuss what are the limits to ground-source heat pumps. </p><h3>Heat pumps, compared with combined heat and power</h3><p class="first">I used to think that combined heat and power was a no-brainer. &ldquo;Obviously, we should use the discarded heat from power stations to heat buildings rather than just chucking it up a cooling tower!&rdquo; However, looking carefully at the numbers describing the performance of real CHP systems, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that there are better ways of providing electric </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure185.png" width="221" height="268" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.11</span>. The inner and outer bits of an air-source heat pump that has a coefficient of performance of 4. The inner bit is accompanied by a ball-point pen, for scale. One of these Fujitsu units can deliver 3.6 kW of heating when using just 0.845 kW of electricity. It can also run in reverse, delivering 2.6 kW of cooling when using 0.655 kW of electricity.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">formance of 3 or 4, assuming that the extra electricity for the heat pumps is generated by an average gas power station or by a top-of-the-line gas power station, and allowing for 8% loss in the national electricity network between the power station and the building where the heat pumps pump heat. The top-of-the-line gas power station&rsquo;s efficiency is 53%, assuming it&rsquo;s running optimally. (I imagine the Carbon Trust and Nimbus made a similar assumption when providing the numbers used in this diagram for CHP systems.) In the future, heat pumps will probably get even better than I assumed here. In Japan, thanks to strong legislation favouring effi- ciency improvements, heat pumps are now available with a coefficient of performance of 4.9. </p><p>Notice that heat pumps offer a system that can be &ldquo;better than 100%- efficient.&rdquo; For example the &ldquo;best gas&rdquo; power station, feeding electricity to heat pumps can deliver a combination of 30%-efficient electricity and 80%- efficient heat, a &ldquo;total efficiency&rdquo; of 110%. No plain CHP system could ever match this performance. </p><p>Let me spell this out. Heat pumps are superior in efficiency to condens- ing boilers, even if the heat pumps are powered by electricity from a power station burning natural gas. If you want to heat lots of buildings using natural gas, you could install condensing boilers, which are &ldquo;90% ef- ficient,&rdquo; or you could send the same gas to a new gas power station making electricity and install electricity-powered heat pumps in all the buildings; the second solution&rsquo;s efficiency would be somewhere between 140% and 185%. It&rsquo;s not necessary to dig big holes in the garden and install underfloor heating to get the benefits of heat pumps; the best air-source heat pumps (which require just a small external box, like an air-conditioner&rsquo;s) can deliver hot water to normal radiators with a coefficient of performance above 3. The air-source heat pump in figure 21.11 (p147) directly delivers warm air to an office. </p><p>I thus conclude that combined heat and power, even though it sounds a good idea, is probably not the best way to heat buildings and make electricity using natural gas, assuming that air-source or ground-source heat pumps can be installed in the buildings. The heat-pump solution has further advantages that should be emphasized: heat pumps can be located in any buildings where there is an electricity supply; they can be driven by any electricity source, so they keep on working when the gas runs out or the gas price goes through the roof; and heat pumps are flexible: they can be turned on and off to suit the demand of the building occupants. </p><p>I emphasize that this critical comparison does not mean that CHP is always a bad idea. What I&rsquo;m comparing here are methods for heating ordinary buildings, which requires only very low-grade heat. CHP can also be used to deliver higher-grade heat to industrial users (at 200 &deg;C, for example). In such industrial settings, heat pumps are unlikely to compete so well because their coefficient of performance would be lower. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img src="figure183.png" width="496" height="116" alt=""><h3>Limits to growth (of heat pumps)</h3><p class="first">Because the temperature of the ground, a few metres down, stays sluggishly close to 11 &deg;C, whether it&rsquo;s summer or winter, the ground is theoretically a better place for a heat pump to grab its heat than the air, which in midwinter may be 10 or 15 &deg;C colder than the ground. So heat-pump advisors encourage the choice of ground-source over air-source heat pumps, where possible. (Heat pumps work less efficiently when there&rsquo;s a big temperature difference between the inside and outside.) </p><p>However, the ground is not a limitless source of heat. The heat has to come from somewhere, and ground is not a very good thermal conductor. If we suck heat too fast from the ground, the ground will become as cold as ice, and the advantage of the ground-source heat pump will be diminished. </p><p>In Britain, the main purpose of heat pumps would be to get heat into buildings in the winter. The ultimate source of this heat is the sun, which replenishes heat in the ground by direct radiation and by conduction through the air. The rate at which heat is sucked from the ground must satisfy two constraints: it must not cause the ground&rsquo;s temperature to drop too low during the winter; and the heat sucked in the winter must be replenished somehow during the summer. If there&rsquo;s any risk that the <em>natural</em> trickling of heat in the summer won&rsquo;t make up for the heat removed in the winter, then the replenishment must be driven <em>actively</em> &ndash; for example by running the system in reverse in summer, putting heat down into the ground (and thus providing air-conditioning up top). </p><p>Let&rsquo;s put some numbers into this discussion. How big a piece of ground does a ground-source heat pump need? Assume that we have a neighbourhood with quite a high population density &ndash; say 6200 people per km<sup>2</sup> (160 m<sup>2</sup> per person), the density of a typical British suburb. Can <em>everyone</em> use ground-source heat pumps, without using active summer replenishment? A calculation in Chapter E (p303) gives a tentative answer of <em>no</em>: if we wanted everyone in the neighbourhood to be able to pull from the ground a heat flow of about 48 kWh/d per person (my estimate of our typical winter heat demand), we&rsquo;d end up freezing the ground in the winter. Avoiding unreasonable cooling of the ground requires that the sucking rate be less than 12 kWh/d per person. So if we switch to ground-source heat pumps, we should plan to include substantial summer heat-dumping in the design, so as to refill the ground with heat for use in the winter. This summer heat-dumping could use heat from air-conditioning, or heat from </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:8em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 21.12</span>.

Alternatively, we should expect to need to use some air-source heat pumps too, and then we&rsquo;ll be able to get all the heat we want &ndash; as long as we have the electricity to pump it. In the UK, air temperatures don&rsquo;t go very far below freezing, so concerns about poor winter-time performance of air-source pumps, which might apply in North America and Scandanavia, probably do not apply in Britain. </p><p>My conclusion: can we reduce the energy we consume for heating? Yes. Can we get off fossil fuels at the same time? Yes. Not forgetting the low-hanging fruit &ndash; building-insulation and thermostat shenanigans &ndash; we should replace all our fossil-fuel heaters with electric-powered heat pumps; we can reduce the energy required to 25% of today&rsquo;s levels. Of course this plan for electrification would require more electricity. But even if the extra electricity came from gas-fired power stations, that would still be a much better way to get heating than what we do today, simply setting fire to the gas. Heat pumps are future-proof, allowing us to heat buildings efficiently with electricity from any source. </p><p>Nay-sayers object that the coefficient of performance of air-source heat pumps is lousy &ndash; just 2 or 3. But their information is out of date. If we are careful to buy top-of-the-line heat pumps, we can do much better. The Japanese government legislated a decade-long efficiency drive that has greatly improved the performance of air-conditioners; thanks to this drive, there are now air-source heat pumps with a coefficient of performance of 4.9; these heat pumps can make hot water as well as hot air. </p><p>Another objection to heat pumps is &ldquo;oh, we can&rsquo;t approve of people fitting efficient air-source heaters, because they might use them for air- conditioning in the summer.&rdquo; Come on &ndash; I hate gratuitous air-conditioning as much as anyone, but these heat pumps are four times more efficient than any other winter heating method! Show me a better choice. Wood pellets? Sure, a few wood-scavengers can burn wood. But there is not enough wood for everyone to do so. For forest-dwellers, there&rsquo;s wood. For everyone else, there&rsquo;s heat pumps. </p><h2>Notes and further reading</h2><div class="endnote"><p>page no.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="mark">142</span><em class="darkred">Loft and cavity insulation reduces heat loss in a typical old house by about a quarter</em>.

Yes, switching off gadgets when they&rsquo;re not in use is an easy way to make a difference. Energy-efficient light bulbs will save you electricity too. </p><p>We already examined gadgets in Chapter 11. Some gadgets are unim- portant, but some are astonishing guzzlers. The laser-printer in my office, sitting there doing nothing, is slurping 17 W &ndash; nearly 0.5 kWh per day! A friend bought a lamp from IKEA. Its awful adaptor (figure 22.1) guzzles 10 W (0.25 kWh per day) whether or not the lamp is on. If you add up a few stereos, DVD players, cable modems, and wireless devices, you may even find that half of your home electricity consumption can be saved. </p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, standby power con- sumption accounts for roughly 8% of residential electricity demand. In the UK and France, the average standby power is about 0.75 kWh/d per household. The problem isn&rsquo;t standby itself &ndash; it&rsquo;s the shoddy way in which standby is implemented. It&rsquo;s perfectly possible to make standby systems that draw less than 0.01 W; but manufacturers, saving themselves a penny in the manufacturing costs, are saddling the consumer with an annual cost of pounds. </p><img style="padding: 2em 0 2em 0" src="figure187.png" width="401" height="264" alt=""><h2>A vampire-killing experiment</h2><p class="first">Figure 22.2 shows an experiment I did at home.

We found that we could halve the power consumption of transport (and de-fossilize it) by switching to electric vehicles. We found that we could shrink the power consumption of heating even more (and de-fossilize it) by insulating all buildings better and using electric heat pumps instead of fossil fuels. So yes, we can reduce consumption. But still, matching even this reduced consumption with power from Britain&rsquo;s own renewables looks very challenging (figure 18.7, p109). It&rsquo;s time to discuss non-renewable options for power produc- tion.</p><p>Take the known reserves of fossil fuels, which are overwhelmingly coal: 1600 Gt of coal. Share them equally between six billion people, and burn them &ldquo;sustainably.&rdquo; What do we mean if we talk about using up a finite resource &ldquo;sustainably&rdquo;? Here&rsquo;s the arbitrary definition I&rsquo;ll use: the burn-rate is &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; if the resources would last <span class="red">1000 years</span>. A ton of coal delivers 8000 kWh of chemical energy, so 1600 Gt of coal shared be- tween 6 billion people over 1000 years works out to a power of <span class="green">6 kWh per day per person</span>. A standard coal power station would turn this chemical power into electricity with an efficiency of about 37% &ndash; that means about <span class="green">2.2 kWh(e) per day per person</span>. If we care about the climate, however, then presumably we would not use a standard power station. Rather, we would go for &ldquo;clean coal,&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;coal with carbon capture and storage&rdquo; &ndash; an as-yet scarcely-implemented technology that sucks most of the carbon dioxide out of the chimney-flue gases and then shoves it down a hole in the ground. Cleaning up power station emissions in this way has a significant energy cost &ndash; it would reduce the delivered electricity by about 25%. So a &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; use of known coal reserves would deliver only about <span class="green">1.6 kWh(e) per day per person</span>. </p><p>We can compare this &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; coal-burning rate &ndash; 1.6 Gt per year &ndash; with the current global rate of coal consumption: 6.3 Gt per year, and rising. </p><p>What about the UK alone?

The coal-burning process releases greenhouse gases not only at the power station but also at the coal mine. Coal-mining tends to release methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, both di- rectly from the coal seams as they are exposed, and subsequently from discarded shales and mudstones; for an ordinary coal power station, these coal-mine emissions bump up the greenhouse gas footprint by about 2%, so for a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; coal power station, these emissions may have some impact on the accounts. There&rsquo;s a similar accounting problem with natural gas: if, say, 5% of the natural gas leaks out along the journey from hole in the ground to power station, then this accidental methane pollution is equiva- lent (in greenhouse effect) to a 40% boost in the carbon dioxide released at the power station. </p><h2>New coal technologies</h2><p class="first">Stanford-based company <span class="websitetitle">directcarbon.com</span> are developing the <em>Direct Car- bon Fuel Cell</em>, which converts fuel and air directly to electricity and CO<sub>2</sub>, without involving any water or steam turbines. They claim that this way of generating electricity from coal is twice as efficient as the standard power station. </p><h2>When&rsquo;s the end of business as usual?</h2><p class="first">The economist Jevons did a simple calculation in 1865. People were dis- cussing how long British coal would last. They tended to answer this question by dividing the estimated coal remaining by the rate of coal consumption, getting answers like &ldquo;1000 years.&rdquo; But, Jevons said, consumption is <em>not</em> constant. It&rsquo;s been doubling every 20 years, and &ldquo;progress&rdquo; would have it continue to do so. So &ldquo;reserves divided by consumption-rate&rdquo; gives the wrong answer. </p><p>Instead, Jevons extrapolated the exponentially-growing consumption, calculating the time by which the total amount consumed would exceed the estimated reserves. This was a much shorter time. Jevons was not assuming that consumption would actually continue to grow at the same rate; rather he was making the point that growth was not sustainable. His calculation estimated for his British readership the inevitable limits </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure425.png" width="219" height="150" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 23.3</span>.

I think that&rsquo;s as big a mistake as if you lumped nuclear medicine in with nuclear weapons.</p><cite>Patrick Moore, former Director of Greenpeace International </cite></blockquote><p class="first">Nuclear power comes in two flavours. Nuclear <em>fission</em> is the flavour that we know how to use in power stations; fission uses uranium, an exceptionally heavy element, as fuel. Nuclear <em>fusion</em> is the flavour that we don&rsquo;t yet know how to implement in power stations; fusion would use light elements, especially hydrogen, as its fuel. Fission reactions split up heavy nuclei into medium-sized nuclei, releasing energy. Fusion reactions fuse light nuclei into medium-sized nuclei, releasing energy. </p><p>Both forms of nuclear power, fission and fusion, have an important property: the nuclear energy available per atom is roughly one million times bigger than the chemical energy per atom of typical fuels. This means that the amounts of fuel and waste that must be dealt with at a nuclear reactor can be up to one million times smaller than the amounts of fuel and waste at an equivalent fossil-fuel power station. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s try to personalize these ideas. The mass of the fossil fuels con- sumed by &ldquo;the average British person&rdquo; is about 16 kg per day (4 kg of coal, 4 kg of oil, and 8 kg of gas). That means that every single day, an amount of fossil fuels with the same weight as 28 pints of milk is extracted from a hole in the ground, transported, processed, and burned somewhere on your behalf. The average Brit&rsquo;s fossil fuel habit creates 11 tons per year of waste carbon dioxide; that&rsquo;s 30 kg per day. In the previous chapter we raised the idea of capturing waste carbon dioxide, compressing it into solid or liquid form, and transporting it somewhere for disposal. Imagine that one person was responsible for capturing and dealing with all their own carbon dioxide waste. 30 kg per day of carbon dioxide is a substantial rucksack-full every day &ndash; the same weight as 53 pints of milk! </p><p>In contrast, the amount of natural uranium required to provide the same amount of energy as 16 kg of fossil fuels, in a standard fission reactor, is 2 grams; and the resulting waste weighs one quarter of a gram. (This 2 g of uranium is not as small as one millionth of 16 kg per day, by the way, because today&rsquo;s reactors burn up less than 1% of the uranium.) To deliver 2 grams of uranium per day, the miners at the uranium mine would have to deal with perhaps 200 g of ore per day. </p><p>So the material streams flowing into and out of nuclear reactors are small, relative to fossil-fuel streams. &ldquo;Small is beautiful,&rdquo; but the fact that the nuclear waste stream is small doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not a problem; it&rsquo;s just a &ldquo;beautifully small&rdquo; problem. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure192.png" width="197" height="742" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.1</span>.

Leaving aside for a moment the usual questions about safety and waste-disposal, a key question is whether humanity could live for generations on fission. How great are the world wide supplies of uranium, and other fissionable fuels? Do we have only a few decades&rsquo; worth of uranium, or do we have enough for millennia? </p><p>To estimate a &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; power from uranium, I took the total recov- erable uranium in the ground and in seawater, divided it fairly between 6 billion humans, and asked &ldquo;how fast can we use this if it has to last 1000 years?&rdquo; </p><p>Almost all the recoverable uranium is in the oceans, not in the ground: seawater contains 3.3 mg of uranium per m<sup>3</sup> of water, which adds up to 4.5 billion tons worldwide. I called the uranium in the ocean &ldquo;recoverable&rdquo; but this is a bit inaccurate &ndash; most ocean waters are quite inaccessible, and the ocean conveyor belt rolls round only once every 1000 years or so; and no-one has yet demonstrated uranium-extraction from seawater on an in dustrial scale. So we&rsquo;ll make separate estimates for two cases: first using only mined uranium, and second using ocean uranium too. </p><p>The uranium ore in the ground that&rsquo;s extractable at prices below $130 per kg of uranium is about one thousandth of this. If prices went above $130 per kg, phosphate deposits that contain uranium at low concentra- tions would become economic to mine. Recovery of uranium from phosp- hates is perfectly possible, and was done in America and Belgium before 1998. For the estimate of mined uranium, I&rsquo;ll add both the conventional uranium ore and the phosphates, to give a total resource of 27 million tons of uranium (table 24.2). </p><p>We&rsquo;ll consider two ways to use uranium in a reactor: (a) the widely-used <em>once-through method</em> gets energy mainly fromthe <sup>235</sup>U (which makes up just 0.7% of uranium), and discards the remaining <sup>238</sup>U; (b) <em>fast breeder reactors</em>, which are more expensive to build, convert the <sup>238</sup>U to fission able plutonium-239 and obtain roughly 60 times as much energy from the uranium. </p><h3>Once-through reactors, using uranium from the ground</h3><p class="first">A once-through <strong>one-gigawatt</strong> nuclear power station uses <strong>162 tons per year of uranium</strong>. So the known mineable resources of uranium, shared between 6 billion people, would last for 1000 years if we produced nuclear power at a rate of <span class="green">0.55 kWh per day per person</span>. This sustainable rate is the output of just 136 nuclear power stations, and is half of today&rsquo;s nuclear power production.

Indeed, one paper published in 1980 estimated that the low-grade uranium resource is more than 1000 times greater than the 27 million tons we just assumed. </p><p>Could our current once-through use of mined uranium be sustainable? It&rsquo;s hard to say, since there is such uncertainty about the result of future exploration. Certainly at today&rsquo;s rate of consumption, once-through reac- tors could keep going for hundreds of years. But if we wanted to crank up nuclear power 40-fold worldwide, in order to get off fossil fuels and to al- low standards of living to rise, we might worry that once-through reactors are not a sustainable technology. </p><h3>Fast breeder reactors, using uranium from the ground</h3><p class="first">Uranium can be used 60 times more efficiently in fast breeder reactors, which burn up all the uranium &ndash; both the <sup>238</sup>U and the <sup>235</sup>U (in contrast to the once-through reactors, which burn mainly <sup>235</sup>U). As long as we don&rsquo;t chuck away the spent fuel that is spat out by once-through reactors, this source of depleted uranium could be used too, so uranium that is put in once-through reactors need not be wasted. If we used all the mineable uranium (plus the depleted uranium stockpiles) in 60-times-more-efficient fast breeder reactors, the power would be <span class="green">33 kWh per day per person</span>. Attitudes to fast breeder reactors range from &ldquo;this is a dangerous failed experimental technology whereof one should not speak&rdquo; to &ldquo;we can and should start building breeder reactors right away.&rdquo; I am not competent to comment on the risks of breeder technology, and I don&rsquo;t want to mix ethical assertions with factual assertions. My aim is just to help understand the numbers. The one ethical position I wish to push is &ldquo;we should have a plan that adds up.&rdquo; </p><h3>Once-through, using uranium from the oceans</h3><p class="first">The oceans&rsquo; uranium, if completely extracted and used in once-through reactors, corresponds to a total energy of </p><table class="fraction" summary=""><tr><td>4.5 billion tons per planet</td><td rowspan="2">&nbsp;=&nbsp;28 million GW-years per planet.</td></tr><tr><td class="upper_line">162 tons uranium per GW-year</td></tr></table><p class="first">How fast could uranium be extracted from the oceans?

If 10% of this influx were captured, it would provide enough fuel for 20 GW of once-through reactors, or 1200 GW of fast breeder reactors. The fast breeder reactors would deliver <span class="green">5 kWh per day per person</span>. </p><p>All these numbers are summarized in figure 24.6.</p><h3>What about costs?</h3><p class="first">As usual in this book, my main calculations have paid little attention to economics. However, since the potential contribution of ocean-uranium- based power is one of the biggest in our &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; production list, it seems appropriate to discuss whether this uranium-power figure is at all economically plausible. </p><p>Japanese researchers have found a technique for extracting uranium from seawater at a cost of $100&ndash;300 per kilogram of uranium, in compar- ison with a current cost of about $20/kg for uranium from ore. Because uranium contains so much more energy per ton than traditional fuels, this 5-fold or 15-fold increase in the cost of uranium would have little effect on the cost of nuclear power: nuclear power&rsquo;s price is dominated by the cost of power-station construction and decommissioning, not by the cost of the fuel. Even a price of $300/kg would increase the cost of nuclear energy by only about 0.3 p per kWh. The expense of uranium extraction could be reduced by combining it with another use of seawater &ndash; for example, power-station cooling. </p><p>We&rsquo;re not home yet: does the Japanese technique scale up? What is the energy cost of processing all the seawater? In the Japanese experiment, three cages full of adsorbent uranium-attracting material weighing 350 kg collected &ldquo;more than 1 kg of yellow cake in 240 days;&rdquo; this figure corresponds to about 1.6 kg per year. The cages had a cross-sectional area of 48 m<sup>2</sup>. To power a once-through 1 GW nuclear power station, we need 160 000 kg per year, which is a production rate 100 000 times greater than the Japanese experiment&rsquo;s. If we simply scaled up the Japanese technique, which accumulated uranium passively from the sea, a power of 1 GW would thus need cages having a collecting area of 4.8 km<sup>2</sup> and containing a weight of 350 000 tons of adsorbent material &ndash; more than the weight of the steel in the reactor itself. To put these large numbers in human terms, if uranium were delivering, say, 22 kWh per day per person, each 1 GW reactor would be shared between 1 million people, each of whom needs 0.16 kg of uranium per year. So each person would require one tenth of the Japanese experimental facility, with a weight of 35 kg per person, and an area of <span class="darkblue">5 m<sup>2</sup></span> per person. The proposal that such uranium-extraction facilities should be created is thus similar in scale to proposals such as &ldquo;every person should have <span class="darkblue">10 m<sup>2</sup></span> of solar panels&rdquo; and &ldquo;every person should have a </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">one-ton car and a dedicated parking place for it.&rdquo; A large investment, yes, but not absurdly off scale. And that was the calculation for once-through reactors. For fast breeder reactors, 60 times less uranium is required, so the mass per person of the uranium collector would be 0.5 kg. </p><h2>Thorium</h2><p class="first">Thorium is a radioactive element similar to uranium. Formerly used to make gas mantles, it is about three times as abundant in the earth&rsquo;s crust as uranium. Soil commonly contains around 6 parts per million of thorium, and some minerals contain 12% thorium oxide. Seawater contains little thorium, because thorium oxide is insoluble. Thorium can be completely burned up in simple reactors (in contrast to standard uranium reactors which use only about 1% of natural uranium). Thorium is used in nuclear reactors in India. If uranium ore runs low, thorium will probably become the dominant nuclear fuel. </p><p>Thorium reactors deliver 3.6 billion kWh of heat per ton of thorium, which implies that a 1 GW reactor requires about 6 tons of thorium per year, assuming its generators are 40% efficient. Worldwide thorium re- sources are estimated to total about 6 million tons, four times more than the known reserves shown in table 24.7. As with the uranium resources, it seems plausible that these thorium resources are an underestimate, since thorium prospecting is not highly valued today. If we assume, as with ura- nium, that these resources are used up over 1000 years and shared equally among 6 billion people, we find that the &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; power thus generated is <span class="green">4 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><p>An alternative nuclear reactor for thorium, the &ldquo;energy amplifier&rdquo; or &ldquo;accelerator-driven system&rdquo; proposed by Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia and his colleagues would, they estimated, convert 6 million tons of thorium to 15 000 TWy of energy, or 60 kWh/d per person over 1000 years. Assuming conversion to electricity at 40% efficiency, this would deliver <span class="green">24 kWh/d per person</span> for 1000 years. And the waste from the energy amplifier would be much less radioactive too. They argue that, in due course, many times more thorium would be economically extractable than the current 6 million tons. If their suggestion &ndash; 300 times more &ndash; is correct, then thorium and the energy amplifier could offer 120 kWh/d per person for 60 000 years. </p><h2>Land use</h2><p class="first">Let&rsquo;s imagine that Britain decides it is serious about getting off fossil fuels, and creates a lot of new nuclear reactors, even though this may not be &ldquo;sustainable.&rdquo; If we build enough reactors to make possible a significant decarbonization of transport and heating, can we fit the required nuclear reactors into Britain?

Let&rsquo;s imagine generating 22 kWh per day per person of nuclear power &ndash; equivalent to 55 GW (roughly the same as France&rsquo;s nuclear power), which could be delivered by 55 nuclear power stations, each occu- pying one square kilometre. That&rsquo;s about 0.02% of the area of the country. Wind farms delivering the same average power would require 500 times as much land: 10% of the country. If the nuclear power stations were placed in pairs around the coast (length about 3000 km, at 5 km resolution), then there&rsquo;d be two every 100 km. Thus while the area required is modest, the fraction of coastline gobbled by these power stations would be about 2% (2 kilometres in every 100). </p><h2>Economics of cleanup</h2><p class="first">What&rsquo;s the cost of cleaning up nuclear power sites?

The THORP reprocessing facility at Sellafield, built in 1994 at a cost of &pound;1.8 billion, had a growing leak from a broken pipe from August 2004 to April 2005. Over eight months, the leak let <em><span class="darkblue">85 000 litres</span></em> of uranium-rich fluid flow into a sump which was equipped with safety systems that were designed to detect immediately any leak of as little as <em><span class="darkblue">15 litres</span></em>. But the leak went undetected because the operators hadn&rsquo;t completed the checks that ensured the safety systems were working; and the operators were in the habit of ignoring safety alarms anyway. </p><p>The safety system came with belt and braces. Independent of the failed safety alarms, routine safety-measurements of fluids in the sump should have detected the abnormal presence of uranium within one month of the start of the leak; but the operators often didn&rsquo;t bother taking these routine measurements, because they felt too busy; and when they <em>did</em> take mea- surements that detected the abnormal presence of uranium in the sump (on 28 August 2004, 26 November 2004, and 24 February 2005), no action was taken. </p><p>By April 2005, <em><span class="darkblue">22 tons</span></em> of uranium had leaked, but still none of the leak-detection systems detected the leak. The leak was finally detected by <em>accountancy</em>, when the bean-counters noticed that they were getting 10% less uranium out than their clients claimed they&rsquo;d put in!

I don&rsquo;t know. </p><p>At the same time, we must not let ourselves be swept off our feet in horror at the danger of nuclear power. Nuclear power is not infinitely dangerous. It&rsquo;s just dangerous, much as coal mines, petrol repositories, fossil-fuel burning and wind turbines are dangerous. Even if we have no guarantee against nuclear accidents in the future, I think the right way to assess nuclear is to compare it objectively with other sources of power. Coal power stations, for example, expose the public to nuclear radiation, because coal ash typically contains uranium. Indeed, according to a paper published in the journal <em>Science</em>, people in America living near coal-fired power stations are exposed to higher radiation doses than those living near nuclear power plants. </p><p>When quantifying the public risks of different power sources, we need a new unit. I&rsquo;ll go with &ldquo;deaths per GWy (gigawatt-year).&rdquo; Let me try to convey what it would mean if a power source had a death rate of 1 death per GWy. One gigawatt-year is the energy produced by a 1 GW power station, if it operates flat-out for one year. Britain&rsquo;s electricity consumption is roughly 45 GW, or, if you like, 45 gigawatt-years per year. So if we got our electricity from sources with a death rate of 1 death per GWy, that would mean the British electricity supply system was killing 45 people per year. For comparison, 3000 people die per year on Britain&rsquo;s roads. So, if you are <em>not</em> campaigning for the abolition of roads, you may deduce that &ldquo;1 death per GWy&rdquo; is a death rate that, while sad, you might be content to live with. Obviously, 0.1 deaths per GWy would be preferable, but it takes only a moment&rsquo;s reflection to realize that, sadly, fossil-fuel energy production must have a cost greater than 0.1 deaths per GWy &ndash; just think of disasters on oil rigs; helicopters lost at sea; pipeline fires; refinery explosions; and coal mine accidents: there are tens of fossil-chain fatalities per year in Britain. </p><p>So, let&rsquo;s discuss the actual death rates of a range of electricity sources. The death rates vary a lot from country to country. In China, for example, the death rate in coal mines, per ton of coal delivered, is 50 times that of most nations. Figure 24.11 shows numbers from studies by the Paul Scherrer Institute and by a European Union project called ExternE, which made comprehensive estimates of all the impacts of energy production. According to the EU figures, coal, lignite, and oil have the highest death rates, followed by peat and biomass-power, with death rates above 1 per GWy. Nuclear and wind are the best, with death rates below 0.2 per GWy. Hydroelectricity is the best of all according to the EU study, but comes out worst in the Paul Scherrer Institute&rsquo;s study, because the latter surveyed a different set of countries. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure199.png" width="186" height="722" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.11</span>.

The GT-MHR power plant, for example, is claimed to be inherently safe; and, moreover it has a higher efficiency of conversion of heat to electricity than conventional nuclear plants [<span class="websitetitle">gt-mhr.ga.com</span>]. </p><h2>Mythconceptions</h2><p class="first">Two widely-cited defects of nuclear power are construction costs, and waste. Let&rsquo;s examine some aspects of these issues. </p><h4>Building a nuclear power station requires huge amounts of con- crete and steel, materials whose creation involves huge CO2 pollution. </h4><p>The steel and concrete in a 1 GW nuclear power station have a carbon footprint of roughly 300 000 t CO<sub>2</sub>. </p><p>Spreading this &ldquo;huge&rdquo; number over a 25-year reactor life we can express this contribution to the carbon intensity in the standard units (g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh(e)), </p><table class="fraction" id="p169" summary=""><tr><td rowspan="2">carbon intensity associated with construction</td><td rowspan="2">&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>300&times; 10<sup>9</sup> g</td></tr><tr><td class="upper_line">10<sup>6</sup> kW(e) &times; 220 000 h</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>1.4 g/kWh(e),</td></tr></table><p class="first">which is much smaller than the fossil-fuel benchmark of 400 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh(e). The IPCC estimates that the total carbon intensity of nuclear power (in- cluding construction, fuel processing, and decommissioning) is less than 40 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh(e) (Sims et al., 2007). </p><p>Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I&rsquo;m not trying to be pro-nuclear. I&rsquo;m just pro-arithmetic. </p><h4>Isn&rsquo;t the waste from nuclear reactors a huge problem?</h4><p>As we noted in the opening of this chapter, the volume of waste from nuclear reactors is relatively small. Whereas the ash from ten coal-fired power stations would have a mass of four million tons per year (having a volume of roughly 40 litres per person per year), the nuclear waste from Britain&rsquo;s ten nuclear power stations has a volume of just 0.84 litres per person per year &ndash; think of that as a bottle of wine per person per year (figure 24.13). </p><p>Most of this waste is low-level waste. 7% is intermediate-level waste, and just 3% of it &ndash; 25 ml per year &ndash; is high-level waste. </p><p>The high-level waste is the really nasty stuff. It&rsquo;s conventional to keep the high-level waste at the reactor for its first 40 years. It is stored in pools of water and cooled. After 40 years, the level of radioactivity has dropped 1000-fold. The level of radioactivity continues to fall; after 1000 years,<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#169><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> the </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure200.png" width="219" height="603" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.12</span>.

The area of the earth per person would be 51 000 m<sup>2</sup>. Dividing the power per person by the area per person, we find that the extra power contributed by human energy use would be 0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>. That&rsquo;s one fortieth of the 4 W/m<sup>2</sup> that we&rsquo;re currently fretting about, and a little smaller than the 0.25 W/m<sup>2</sup> effect of solar vari- ations. So yes, under these assumptions, human power production would <em>just</em> show up as a contributor to global climate change. </p><h4>I heard that nuclear power can&rsquo;t be built at a sufficient rate to make a useful contribution. </h4><p>The difficulty of building nuclear power fast has been exaggerated with the help of a misleading presentation technique I call &ldquo;the magic playing field.&rdquo; In this technique, two things appear to be compared, but the basis of the comparison is switched halfway through. The Guardian&rsquo;s environment editor, summarizing a report from the <em>Oxford Research Group</em>, wrote &ldquo;For nuclear power to make any significant contribution to a reduction in global carbon emissions in the next two generations, the industry would have to construct nearly 3000 new reactors &ndash; or about one a week for 60 years. A civil nuclear construction and supply programme on this scale is a pipe dream, and completely unfeasible. The highest historic rate is 3.4 new reactors a year.&rdquo; 3000 sounds much bigger than 3.4, doesn&rsquo;t it! In this application of the &ldquo;magic playing field&rdquo; technique, there is a switch not only of <span class="red">timescale</span> but also of <span class="darkblue">region</span>. While the first figure (3000 new reactors <span class="red">over 60 years</span>) is the number required <em><span class="darkblue">for the whole planet</span></em>, the second figure (3.4 new reactors <span class="red">per year</span>) is the maximum rate of building by a <em><span class="darkblue">single country</span></em> (France)! </p><p>A more honest presentation would have kept the comparison on a per- planet basis. France has 59 of the world&rsquo;s 429 operating nuclear reactors, so it&rsquo;s plausible that the highest rate of reactor building for the whole planet was something like ten times France&rsquo;s, that is, 34 new reactors per year. And the required rate (3000 new reactors over 60 years) is 50 new reactors per year. So the assertion that &ldquo;civil nuclear construction on this scale is a pipe dream, and completely unfeasible&rdquo; is poppycock. Yes, it&rsquo;s a big construction rate, but it&rsquo;s in the same ballpark as historical construction rates. </p><p>How reasonable is my assertion that the world&rsquo;s maximum historical construction rate must have been about 34 new nuclear reactors per year? Let&rsquo;s look at the data. Figure 24.14 shows the power of the world&rsquo;s nuclear fleet as a function of time, showing only the power stations still operational in 2007. The rate of new build was biggest in 1984, and had a value of (drum-roll please...) about 30 GW per year &ndash; about 30 1-GW reactors.

The idea is pretty. The problem is, we don&rsquo;t know how to make the box.</p><cite>S&acute;ebastien Balibar, Director of Research, CNRS</cite></blockquote><p class="first">Fusion power is speculative and experimental. I think it is reckless to assume that the fusion problem <em>will</em> be cracked, but I&rsquo;m happy to estimate how much power fusion could deliver, <em>if</em> the problem is cracked. </p><p>The two fusion reactions that are considered the most promising are: </p> <p class="first"><strong>the DT reaction</strong>, which fuses deuterium with tritium, making helium; and </p> <p class="first"><strong>the DD reaction</strong>, which fuses deuterium with deuterium. </p> <p class="first">Deuterium, a naturally occurring heavy isotope of hydrogen, can be ob- tained from seawater; tritium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, isn&rsquo;t found in large quantities naturally (because it has a half-life of only 12 years) but it can be manufactured from lithium. </p><p>ITER is an international project to figure out how to make a steadily- working fusion reactor. The ITER prototype will use the DT reaction. DT is preferred over DD, because the DT reaction yields more energy and be- cause it requires a temperature of &ldquo;only&rdquo; 100 million &deg;C to get it going, whereas the DD reaction requires 300 million &deg;C. (The maximum temper- ature in the sun is 15 million &deg;C.) </p><p>Let&rsquo;s fantasize, and assume that the ITER project is successful. What sustainable power could fusion then deliver? Power stations using the DT reaction, fuelled by lithium, will run out of juice when the lithium runs out. Before that time, hopefully the second installment of the fantasy will have arrived: fusion reactors using deuterium alone. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll call these two fantasy energy sources &ldquo;lithium fusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;deu- terium fusion,&rdquo; naming them after the principal fuel we&rsquo;d worry about in each case. Let&rsquo;s now estimate how much energy each of these sources could deliver. </p><h3>Lithium fusion</h3><p class="first">World lithium reserves are estimated to be 9.5 million tons in ore deposits. If all these reserves were devoted to fusion over 1000 years, the power delivered would be <span class="green">10 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><p>There&rsquo;s another source for lithium: seawater, where lithium has a con- centration of 0.17 ppm. To produce lithium at a rate of 100 million kg per year from seawater is estimated to have an energy requirement of 2.5 kWh(e) per gram of lithium. If the fusion reactors give back 2300 kWh(e) per gram of lithium, the power thus delivered would be 105 kWh/d per person (assuming 6 billion people). At this rate, the lithium in the oceans would last more than a million years. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure204.png" width="219" height="157" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 24.15</span>.

Bearing in mind that the mass of the oceans is 230 million tons per person, we can deduce that there&rsquo;s enough deuterium to supply every person in a ten-fold increased world population with a power of 30 000 kWh per day (that&rsquo;s more than 100 times the average American consumption) for 1 million years (figure 24.17). </p><h2>Notes and further reading</h2><div class="endnote"><p>page no.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="mark">161</span><em class="darkred">Figure 24.1</em>.

(The average ore grade processed in South Africa in 1985 and 1990 was 150 ppm. Phosphates typically average 100 ppm.) Here&rsquo;s what the World Nuclear Association said on the topic of uranium reserves in June 2008: &ldquo;From time to time concerns are raised that the known resources might be insufficient when judged as a multiple of present rate of use. But this is the Limits to Growth fallacy, ... which takes no account of the very limited nature of the knowledge we have at any time of what is actually in the Earth&rsquo;s crust. Our knowledge of geology is such that we can be confident that identified resources of metal minerals are a small fraction of what is there. &ldquo;Measured resources of uranium, the amount known to be economically recoverable from orebodies, are ... dependent on the intensity of past exploration effort, and are basically a statement about what is known rather than what is there in the Earth&rsquo;s crust. &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s present measured resources of uranium (5.5 Mt) ... are enough to last for over 80 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Economically rational players will only invest in finding these new reserves when they are most confident of gaining a return from them, which usually requires positive price messages caused by undersupply trends. If the economic system is working correctly and maximizing capital efficiency, there should never be more than a few decades of any resource commodity in reserves at any point in time.&rdquo; [Exploration has a cost; exploring for uranium, for example, has had a cost of $1&ndash;$1.50 per kg of uranium ($3.4/MJ), which is 2% of the spot price of $78/kgU; in contrast, the finding costs of crude oil have averaged around $6/barrel ($1050/MJ) (12% of the spot price) over at least the past three decades.] &ldquo;Unlike the metals which have been in demand for centuries, society has barely begun to utilize uranium. There has been only one cycle of exploration-discovery-production, driven in large part by late 1970s price peaks. &ldquo;It is premature to speak about long-term uranium scarcity when the entire nuclear industry is so young that only one cycle of resource replenishment has been required.&rdquo; <span class="websitetitle">www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf75.html</span> Further reading: Herring (2004); Price and Blaise (2002); Cohen (1983).

See also Jones (1984). These death rates are from studies that are predicting the future. We can also look in the past. In Britain, nuclear power has generated 200 GWy of electricity, and the nuclear industry has had 1 fatality, a worker who died at Chapelcross in 1978 [<span class="tinylink">4f2ekz</span>]. One death per 200 GWy is an impressively low death rate compared with the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, the nuclear-power historical death rate is hard to estimate. The Three Mile Island meltdown killed no-one, and the associated leaks are estimated to have perhaps killed one person in the time since the accident. The accident at Chernobyl first killed 62 who died directly from exposure, and 15 local people who died later of thyroid cancer; it&rsquo;s estimated that nearby, another 4000 died of cancer, and that worldwide, about 5000 people (among 7 million who were exposed to fallout) died of cancer because of Chernobyl (Williams and Baverstock, 2006); but these deaths are impossible to detect because cancers, many of them caused by natural nuclear radiation, already cause 25% of deaths in Europe. One way to estimate a global death rate from nuclear power worldwide is to divide this estimate of Chernobyl&rsquo;s death- toll (9000 deaths) by the cumulative output of nuclear power from 1969 to 1996, which was 3685 GWy. This gives a death rate of 2.4 deaths per GWy. As for deaths attributed to wind, Caithness Windfarm Information Forum <span class="websitetitle">www.caithnesswindfarms.co.uk</span> list 49 fatalities worldwide from 1970 to 2007 (35 wind industry workers and 14 members of the public). In 2007, Paul Gipe listed 34 deaths total worldwide [<span class="websitetitle">www.wind-works.org/articles/BreathLife.html</span>]. In the mid-1990s the mortality rate associated with wind power was 3.5 deaths per GWy. According to Paul Gipe, the worldwide mortality rate of wind power dropped to 1.3 deaths per GWy by the end of 2000. So the historical death rates of both nuclear power and wind are higher than the predicted future death rates. </p><p><span class="mark">169</span><em class="darkred">The steel and concrete in a 1 GW nuclear power station have a carbon footprint of roughly 300 000 t CO<sub>2</sub></em>.

Concentrating solar power stations come in several flavours, arranging their moving mirrors in various geometries, and putting various power conversion technologies at the focus &ndash; Stirling en- gines, pressurized water, or molten salt, for example &ndash; but they all deliver fairly similar average powers per unit area, in the ballpark of <span class="green">15 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. </p><h2>A technology that adds up</h2><p class="first">&ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s power could be provided by a square 100 km by 100 km in the Sahara.&rdquo; Is this true? Concentrating solar power in deserts delivers an average power per unit land area of roughly <span class="green">15 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. So, allowing no space for anything else in such a square, the power delivered would be 150 GW. This is <em>not</em> the same as current world power consumption. It&rsquo;s not even near current world <em>electricity</em> consumption, which is 2000 GW. World power consumption today is 15 000 GW. So the correct statement about power from the Sahara is that today&rsquo;s consumption could be provided by a <em>1000 km by 1000 km</em> square in the desert, completely filled with concentrating solar power. That&rsquo;s four times the area of the UK. And if we are interested in living in an equitable world, we should presumably aim to supply more than <em>today&rsquo;s</em> consumption. To supply every person in the world with an average European&rsquo;s power consumption (125 kWh/d), the area required would be <em>two</em> 1000 km by 1000 km squares in the desert. </p><p>Fortunately, the Sahara is not the only desert, so maybe it&rsquo;s more rele- vant to chop the world into smaller regions, and ask what area is needed in each region&rsquo;s local desert. So, focusing on Europe, &ldquo;what area is required in the North Sahara to supply <em>everyone in Europe and North Africa</em> with an average European&rsquo;s power consumption? Taking the population of Europe and North Africa to be 1 billion, the area required drops to 340 000 km<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to a square <strong>600 km by 600 km</strong>. This area is equal to one Germany, to 1.4 United Kingdoms, or to <strong>16 Waleses</strong>. </p><p>The UK&rsquo;s share of this 16-Wales area would be one Wales: a 145 km by 145 km square in the Sahara would provide all the UK&rsquo;s current primary energy consumption.

The total &ldquo;coastal potential&rdquo; is enough to supply 16 kWh per day per person to 1 billion people. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s try to convey on a map what a realistic plan could look like. Imagine making solar facilities each having an area of 1500 km<sup>2</sup> &ndash; that&rsquo;s roughly the size of London. (Greater London has an area of 1580 km<sup>2</sup>; the M25 orbital motorway around London encloses an area of 2300 km<sup>2</sup>.) Let&rsquo;s call each facility a <em>blob</em>. Imagine that in each of these blobs, half the area is devoted to concentrating power stations with an average power density of 15 W/m<sup>2</sup>, leaving space around for agriculture, buildings, railways, roads, pipelines, and cables. Allowing for 10% transmission loss between the blob and the consumer, each of these blobs generates an average power of 10 GW. Figure 25.8 shows some blobs to scale on a map. To give a sense of the scale of these blobs I&rsquo;ve dropped a few in Britain too. <em>Four</em> of these blobs would have an output roughly equal to Britain&rsquo;s total electricity consumption (16 kWh/d per person for 60 million people). <em>Sixty-five</em> blobs would provide all one billion people in Europe and North Africa with 16 kWh/d per person.

To make these, we plop a high- quality electricity-producing solar cell at the focus of cheap lenses or mirrors. Faiman et al. (2007) say that &ldquo;solar, in its concentrator photovoltaics variety, can be completely cost-competitive with fossil fuel [in desert states such as California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas] without the need for any kind of subsidy.&rdquo; </p><p>According to manufacturers Amonix, this form of concentrating solar power would have an average power per unit land area of <span class="green">18 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. </p><p>Another way to get a feel for required hardware is to personalize. One of the &ldquo;25 kW&rdquo; (peak) collectors shown in figure 25.9 generates on average about 138 kWh per day; the American lifestyle currently uses 250 kWh per day per person. So to get the USA off fossil fuels using solar power, we need roughly two of these 15 m&times;15 m collectors per person. </p><h2>Queries</h2><h4>I&rsquo;m confused! In Chapter 6, you said that the best photovoltaic panels deliver 20 W/m<sup>2</sup> on average, in a place with British sun- niness. Presumably in the desert the same panels would deliver 40 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So how come the concentrating solar power stations deliver only 15&ndash;20 W/m<sup>2</sup>? Surely concentrating power should be even better than plain flat panels?</h4><p>Good question. The short answer is no. Concentrating solar power does not achieve a better power per unit land area than flat panels. The concen- trating contraption has to track the sun, otherwise the sunlight won&rsquo;t be focused right; once you start packing land with sun-tracking contraptions, you have to leave gaps between them; lots of sunlight falls through the gaps and is lost. The reason that people nevertheless make concentrating solar power systems is that, today, flat photovoltaic panels are very expensive, and concentrating systems are cheaper. The concentrating people&rsquo;s goal is not to make systems with big power per unit land area. Land area is cheap (they assume). The goal is to deliver big power per dollar. </p><h4>But if flat panels have bigger power density, why don&rsquo;t you des- cribe covering the Sahara desert with them? </h4><p>Because I am trying to discuss practical options for large-scale sustainable power production for Europe and North Africa by 2050. My guess is that by 2050, mirrors will still be cheaper than photovoltaic panels, so concentrating solar power is the technology on which we should focus. </p><h4>What about solar chimneys?</h4><p>A solar chimney or solar updraft tower uses solar power in a very simple way. A huge chimney is built at the centre of an area covered by a transparent roof made of glass or plastic; because hot air rises, hot air created </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure209.png" width="221" height="265" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 25.9</span>.

One such collector, in an appropriate desert location, generates 138 kWh per day &ndash; enough to cover the energy consumption of half an American. Note the human providing a scale.

Power is extracted from the air-flow by turbines at the base of the chimney. Solar chimneys are fairly simple to build, but they don&rsquo;t deliver a very impressive power per unit area. A pilot plant in Manzanares, Spain operated for seven years between 1982 and 1989. The chimney had a height of 195 m and a diameter of 10 m; the collector had a diameter of 240 m, and its roof had 6000 m<sup>2</sup> of glass and 40 000 m<sup>2</sup> of transparent plastic. It generated 44 MWh per year, which corresponds to a power per unit area of <span class="green">0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Theoretically, the bigger the collector and the taller the chimney, the bigger the power density of a solar chimney becomes. The engineers behind Manzanares reckon that, at a site with a solar radiation of 2300 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> per year (262 W/m<sup>2</sup>), a 1000 m-high tower surrounded by a 7 km-diameter collector could gen- erate 680 GWh per year, an average power of 78 MW. That&rsquo;s a power per unit area of about <span class="green">1.6 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>, which is similar to the power per unit area of windfarms in Britain, and one tenth of the power per unit area I said concentrating solar power stations would deliver. It&rsquo;s claimed that solar chimneys could generate electricity at a price similar to that of conventional power stations. I suggest that countries that have enough land and sunshine to spare should host a big bake-off contest between solar chimneys and concentrating solar power, to be funded by oil-producing and oil-consuming countries. </p><h4>What about getting power from Iceland, where geothermal pow- er and hydroelectricity are so plentiful? </h4><p>Indeed, Iceland already effectively exports energy by powering industries that make energy-intensive products. Iceland produces nearly one ton of aluminium per citizen per year, for example! So from Iceland&rsquo;s point of view, there are great profits to be made. But can Iceland save Europe? I would be surprised if Iceland&rsquo;s power production could be scaled up enough to make sizeable electricity exports even to Britain alone. As a benchmark, let&rsquo;s compare with the England&ndash;France Interconnector, which can deliver up to 2 GW across the English Channel. That maximum power is equivalent to 0.8 kWh per day per person in the UK, roughly 5% of British average electricity consumption. Iceland&rsquo;s average geothermal elec- tricity generation is just 0.3 GW, which is less than 1% of Britain&rsquo;s average electricity consumption. Iceland&rsquo;s average electricity production is 1.1 GW. So to create a link sending power equal to the capacity of the French inter- connector, Iceland would have to <em>triple</em> its electricity production. To provide us with 4 kWh per day per person (roughly what Britain gets from its own nuclear power stations), Iceland&rsquo;s electricity production would have to increase <em>ten-fold</em>. It is probably a good idea to build interconnectors to Iceland, but don&rsquo;t expect them to deliver more than a small contribution. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure210.png" width="219" height="360" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 25.10</span>.

My sources for this number are two companies making concentrating solar power for deserts. <span class="websitetitle">www.stirlingenergy.com</span> says one of its dishes with a 25 kW Stirling engine at its focus can generate 60 000 kWh/y in a favourable desert location. They could be packed at a concentration of one dish per 500 m<sup>2</sup>. That&rsquo;s an average power of <span class="green">14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. They say that solar dish Stirling makes the best use of land area, in terms of energy delivered. <span class="websitetitle">www.ausra.com</span> uses flat mirrors to heat water to 285 &deg;C and drive a steam turbine. The heated, pressurized water can be stored in deep metal-lined caverns to allow power generation at night. Describing a &ldquo;240 MW(e)&rdquo; plant proposed for Australia (Mills and Li&Egrave;vre, 2004), the designers claim that 3.5 km<sup>2</sup> of mirrors would deliver 1.2 TWh(e); that&rsquo;s 38 W/m<sup>2</sup> of mirror. To find the power per unit land area, we need to allow for the gaps between the mirrors. Ausra say they need a 153 km by 153 km square in the desert to supply all US electric power (Mills and Morgan, 2008). Total US electricity is 3600 TWh/y, so they are claiming a power per unit land area of <span class="green">18 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. This technology goes by the name <em>compact linear fresnel reflector</em> (Mills and Morrison, 2000; Mills et al., 2004; Mills and Morgan, 2008). Incidentally, rather than &ldquo;concentrating solar power,&rdquo; the company Ausra prefers to use the term <em>solar thermal electricity</em> (STE); they emphasize the benefits of ther- mal storage, in contrast to concentrating photovoltaics, which don&rsquo;t come with a natural storage option. Trieb and Knies (2004), who are strong proponents of concentrating solar power, project that the alternative concentrating solar power technologies would have powers per unit land area in the following ranges: parabolic troughs, <span class="green">14&ndash;19 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; linear fresnel collector, <span class="green">19&ndash;28 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; tower with helio- stats, <span class="green">9&ndash;14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>; stirling dish, <span class="green">9&ndash;14 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. There are three European demonstration plants for concentrating solar power. Andasol &ndash; using parabolic troughs; Sol&uacute;car PS10, a tower near Seville; and Solartres, a tower using molten salt for heat storage. The Andasol parabolic- trough system shown in figure 25.4 is predicted to deliver 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Sol&uacute;car&rsquo;s &ldquo;11 MW&rdquo; solar tower has 624 mirrors, each 121 m<sup>2</sup>. The mirrors concentrate sunlight to a radiation density of up to 650 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. The receiver receives a peak power of 55 MW. The power station can store 20 MWh of thermal energy, allowing it to keep going during 50 minutes of cloudiness. It was expected to generate 24.2 GWh of electricity per year, and it occupies 55 hectares. That&rsquo;s an average power per unit land area of <span class="green">5 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>.

Most of the big renewables are not turn-off-and-onable. When the wind blows and the sun comes out, power is there for the taking; but maybe two hours later, it&rsquo;s not available any more. Nuclear power stations are not usually designed to be turn-offand- onable either. They are usually on all the time, and their delivered power can be turned down and up only on a timescale of hours. This is a problem because, on an electricity network, consumption and production must be exactly equal all the time. The electricity grid can&rsquo;t <em>store</em> energy. To have an energy plan that adds up every minute of every day, we therefore need <em>something easily turn-off-and-onable</em>. It&rsquo;s commonly assumed that the easily turn-off-and-onable something should be a <em>source</em> of power that gets turned off and on to compensate for the fluctuations of supply relative to demand (for example, a fossil fuel power station!). But another equally effective way to match supply and demand would be to have an easily turn-off-and-onable <em>demand</em> for power &ndash; a sink of power that can be turned off and on at the drop of a hat. </p><p>Either way, the easily turn-off-and-onable something needs to be a <em>big</em> something because electricity demand varies a lot (figure 26.1).

This chapter discusses how to cope with fluctuations in supply and demand, without using fossil fuels. </p><h2>How much do renewables fluctuate?</h2><p class="first">However much we love renewables, we must not kid ourselves about the fact that wind does fluctuate. </p><p>Critics of wind power say: &ldquo;Wind power is intermittent and unpredictable, so it can make no contribution to security of supply; if we create lots of wind power, we&rsquo;ll have to maintain lots of fossil-fuel power plant to replace the wind when it drops.&rdquo; Headlines such as &ldquo;Loss of wind causes Texas power grid emergency&rdquo; reinforce this view. Supporters of wind energy play down this problem: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; <em>individual</em> wind farms may be intermittent, but taken together, the <em>sum</em> of all wind farms in different locations is much less intermittent.&rdquo; </p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at real data and try to figure out a balanced viewpoint. Figure 26.2 shows the summed output of the wind fleet of the Republic of Ireland from April 2006 to April 2007. Clearly wind is intermittent, even if we add up lots of turbines covering a whole country. The UK is a bit larger than Ireland, but the same problem holds there too. Between October 2006 and February 2007 there were 17 days when the output from Britain&rsquo;s 1632 windmills was less than 10% of their capacity. During that period there were five days when output was less than 5% and one day when it was </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.2</span>. Total output, in MW, of all wind farms of the Republic of Ireland, from April 2006 to April 2007 (top), and detail from January 2007 to April 2007 (middle), and February 2007 (bottom). Peak electricity demand in Ireland is about 5000 MW. Its wind &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; in 2007 is 745 MW, dispersed in about 60 wind farms. Data are provided every 15 minutes by <span class="websitetitle">www.eirgrid.com</span>.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img style="padding-bottom:2em" src="figure214.png" width="624" height="186" alt=""><p class="first">only 2%.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s quantify the fluctuations in country-wide wind power. The two issues are short-term changes, and long-term lulls. Let&rsquo;s find the fastest short-term change in a month of Irish wind data. On 11th February 2007, the Irish wind power fell steadily from 415 MW at midnight to 79 MW at 4am. That&rsquo;s a slew rate of 84 MW per hour for a country-wide fleet of capacity 745 MW. (By slew rate I mean the rate at which the delivered power fell or rose &ndash; the slope of the graph on 11th February.) OK: if we scale British wind power up to a capacity of 33 GW (so that it delivers 10 GW on average), we can expect to have occasional slew rates of </p><table class="fraction" id="p188" summary=""><tr><td rowspan="2">84 MW/h&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;</td><td>33 000 MW&nbsp;</td><td rowspan="2">=&nbsp;3700 MW/h,</td></tr><tr><td class="upper_line">745 MW</td></tr></table><p class="first">assuming Britain is like Ireland. So we need to be able to either power <em>up</em> replacements for wind at a rate of 3.7 GW per hour &ndash; that&rsquo;s 4 nuclear power stations going from no power to full power every hour, say &ndash; <em>or</em> we need to be able to suddenly turn <em>down</em> our <em>demand</em> at a rate of 3.7 GW per hour. </p><p>Could these windy demands be met? In answering this question we&rsquo;ll need to talk more about &ldquo;gigawatts.&rdquo; Gigawatts are big country-sized units of power. They are to a country what a kilowatt-hour-per-day is to a person: a nice convenient unit. The UK&rsquo;s average electricity consumption is about 40 GW. We can relate this national number to personal consumption: 1 kWh per day per person is equivalent to 2.5 GW nationally. So if every person uses 16 kWh per day of electricity, then national consumption is 40 GW. </p><p>Is a national slew-rate of <span class="darkblue">4 GW per hour</span> completely outside human experience? No. Every morning, as figure 26.3 shows, British demand climbs by about 13 GW between 6.30am and 8.30am. That&rsquo;s a slew rate of <em><span class="darkblue">6.5 GW per hour</span></em>. So our power engineers already cope, every day, with slew rates bigger than 4GW per hour on the national grid. An extra occasional slew of 4 GW per hour induced by sudden wind variations is no reasonable cause for ditching the idea of country-sized wind farms. It&rsquo;s a problem </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:14em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.3</span>. Electricity demand in Great Britain during two winter weeks of 2006. The left and right scales show the demand in national units (GW) and personal units (kWh/d per person) respectively. These are the same data as in figure 26.1.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">just like problems that engineers have already solved. We simply need to figure out how to match ever-changing supply and demand in a grid with no fossil fuels. I&rsquo;m not saying that the wind-slew problem is <em>already</em> solved &ndash; just that it is a problem of the same size as other problems that have been solved. </p><p>OK, before we start looking for solutions, we need to quantify wind&rsquo;s other problem: long-term lulls. At the start of February 2007, Ireland had a country-wide lull that lasted five days. This was not an unusual event, as you can see in figure 26.2. Lulls lasting two or three days happen several times a year. </p><p>There are two ways to get through lulls. Either we can store up energy somewhere before the lull, or we need to have a way of reducing demand during the entire lull. (Or a mix of the two.) If we have 33 GW of wind turbines delivering an average power of 10 GW then the amount of energy we must either store up in advance or do without during a five-day lull is </p><p class="centrespaced">10 GW&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;(5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;24 h) = 1200 GWh. </p><p class="first">(The gigawatt-hour (GWh) is the cuddly energy unit for nations. Britain&rsquo;s electricity consumption is roughly 1000 GWh per day.) </p><p>To personalize this quantity, an energy store of 1200 GWh for the nation is equivalent to an energy store of 20 kWh per person. Such an energy store would allow the nation to go without 10 GW of electricity for 5 days; or equivalently, every individual to go without 4 kWh per day of electricity for 5 days. </p><h2>Coping with lulls and slews</h2><p class="first">We need to solve two problems &ndash; lulls (long periods with small renewable production), and slews (short-term changes in either supply or demand). We&rsquo;ve quantified these problems, assuming that Britain had roughly 33 GW of wind power. To cope with lulls, we must effectively store up roughly 1200 GWh of energy (20 kWh per person). The slew rate we must cope with is 6.5 GW per hour (or 0.1 kW per hour per person). </p><p>There are two solutions, both of which could scale up to solve these problems. The first solution is a centralized solution, and the second is decentralized. The first solution stores up energy, then copes with fluctuations by turning on and off a <em>source</em> powered from the energy store. The second solution works by turning on and off a piece of <em>demand</em>. </p><p>The first solution is <em>pumped storage</em>. The second uses the batteries of the <em>electric vehicles</em> that we discussed in Chapter 20. Before I describe these solutions, let&rsquo;s discuss a few other ideas for coping with slew. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h3>Other supply-side ways of coping with slew</h3><p class="first">Some of the renewables are turn-off-and-onable. If we had a lot of renew- able power that was easily turn-off-and-onable, all the problems of this chapter would go away. Countries like Norway and Sweden have large and deep hydroelectric supplies which they can turn on and off. What might the options be in Britain? </p><p>First, Britain could have lots of waste incinerators and biomass inciner- ators &ndash; power stations playing the role that is today played by fossil power stations. If these stations were designed to be turn-off-and-onable, there would be cost implications, just as there are costs when we have extra fossil power stations that are only working part-time: their generators would sometimes be idle and sometimes work twice as hard; and most generators aren&rsquo;t as efficient if you keep turning them up and down, compared with running them at a steady speed. OK, leaving cost to one side, the crucial question is how big a turn-off-and-onable resource we might have. If all municipal waste were incinerated, and an equal amount of agricultural waste were incinerated, then the average power from these sources would be about 3 GW. If we built capacity equal to <em>twice</em> this power, making incinerators capable of delivering 6 GW, and thus planning to have them operate only half the time, these would be able to deliver 6 GW throughout periods of high demand, then zero in the wee hours. These power stations could be designed to switch on or off within an hour, thus coping with slew rates of 6 GW per hour &ndash; but only for a maximum slew range of 6 GW! That&rsquo;s a helpful contribution, but not enough slew range in itself, if we are to cope with the fluctuations of 33 GW of wind. </p><p>What about hydroelectricity? Britain&rsquo;s hydroelectric stations have an average load factor of 20% so they certainly have the potential to be turned on and off. Furthermore, hydro has the wonderful feature that it can be turned on and off very quickly. Glendoe, a new hydro station with a capacity of 100 MW, will be able to switch from off to on in 30 seconds, for example. That&rsquo;s a slew rate of 12 GW per hour in just one power station! So a sufficiently large fleet of hydro power stations should be able to cope with the slew introduced by enormous wind farms. However, the capacity of the British hydro fleet is <em>not</em> currently big enough to make much con- tribution to our slew problem (assuming we want to cope with the rapid loss of say 10 or 33 GW of wind power). The total capacity of traditional hydroelectric stations in Britain is only about 1.5 GW. </p><p>So simply switching on and off other renewable power sources is not going to work in Britain. We need other solutions. </p><h2>Pumped storage</h2><p class="first">Pumped storage systems use cheap electricity to shove water from a downhill lake to an uphill lake; then regenerate electricity when it&rsquo;s valuable, </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><table class="framed" id="p191" summary=""><tr><th>station</th><th>power (GW)</th><th>head (m)</th><th>volume (million m<sup>3</sup>)</th><th>energy stored (GWh)</th></tr><tr><td>Ffestiniog</td><td>0.36</td><td>320&ndash;295</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>Cruachan</td><td>0.40</td><td>365&ndash;334</td><td>11.3</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Foyers</td><td>0.30</td><td>178&ndash;172</td><td>13.6</td><td>6.3</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>Dinorwig</td><td>1.80</td><td>542&ndash;494</td><td>6.7</td><td>9.1</td></tr></table><img style="padding-bottom:2em" src="figure215.png" width="371" height="250" alt=""><p class="first">using turbines just like the ones in hydroelectric power stations. </p><p>Britain has four pumped storage facilities, which can store 30 GWh be- tween them (table 26.4, figure 26.6). They are typically used to store excess electricity at night, then return it during the day, especially at moments of peak demand &ndash; a profitable business, as figure 26.5 shows. The Dinorwig power station &ndash; an astonishing cathedral inside a mountain in Snowdonia &ndash; also plays an insurance role: it has enough oomph to restart the national grid in the event of a major failure. Dinorwig can switch on, from 0 to 1.3 GW power, in 12 seconds. </p><p>Dinorwig is the Queen of the four facilities. Let&rsquo;s review her vital statis- tics. The total energy that can be stored in Dinorwig is about 9 GWh. Its upper lake is about 500 m above the lower, and the working volume of 7 million m<sup>3</sup> flows at a maximum rate of 390 m<sup>3</sup>/s, allowing power delivery at 1.7 GW for 5 hours. The efficiency of this storage system is 75%. </p><p>If all four pumped storage stations are switched on simultaneously, they can produce a power of 2.8 GW. They can switch on extremely fast, coping with any slew rate that demand-fluctuations or wind-fluctuations could come up with. However the capacity of 2.8 GW is not enough to replace 10 GW or 33 GW of wind power if it suddenly went missing. Nor is the total energy stored (30 GWh) anywhere near the 1200 GWh we are interested in storing in order to make it through a big lull.

A pumped-storage chamber one kilometre below London has been mooted. </p><p>By building more pumped storage systems, it looks as if we could in- crease our maximum energy store from 30 GWh to 100 GWh or perhaps 400 GWh. Achieving the full 1200 GWh that we were hoping for looks tough, however. Fortunately there is another solution. </p><h2>Demand management using electric vehicles</h2><p class="first">To recap our requirements: we&rsquo;d like to be able to store or do without about 1200 GWh, which is 20 kWh per person; and to cope with swings in supply of up to 33 GW &ndash; that&rsquo;s 0.5 kW per person. These numbers are delightfully similar in size to the energy and power requirements of electric cars. The electric cars we saw in Chapter 20 had energy stores of between 9 kWh and 53 kWh. A national fleet of 30 million electric cars would store an energy similar to 20 kWh per person! Typical battery chargers draw a power of 2 or 3 kW. So simultaneously switching on 30 million battery chargers would create a change in demand of about 60 GW! The average power required to power all the nation&rsquo;s transport, if it were all electric, is roughly 40 or 50 GW. There&rsquo;s therefore a close match between the adoption of electric cars proposed in Chapter 20 and the creation of roughly 33 GW </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.10</span>.

These smart chargers would be aware both of the value of electricity, and of the car user&rsquo;s requirements (for example, &ldquo;my car must be fully charged by 7am on Mon- day morning&rdquo;). The charger would sensibly satisfy the user&rsquo;s requirements by guzzling electricity whenever the wind blows, and switching off when the wind drops, or when other forms of demand increase. These smart chargers would provide a useful service in balancing to the grid, a service which could be rewarded financially. </p><p>We could have an especially robust solution if the cars&rsquo; batteries were exchangeable. Imagine popping in to a filling station and slotting in a set of fresh batteries in exchange for your exhausted batteries. The filling station would be responsible for recharging the batteries; they could do this at the perfect times, turning up and down their chargers so that total supply and demand were always kept in balance. Using exchangeable batteries is an especially robust solution because there could be millions of spare batteries in the filling stations&rsquo; storerooms. These spare batteries would provide an extra buffer to help us get through wind lulls. Some people say, &ldquo;Horrors! How could I trust the filling station to look after my batteries for me? What if they gave me a duff one?&rdquo; Well, you could equally well ask today &ldquo;What if the filling station gave me petrol laced with water?&rdquo; Myself, I&rsquo;d much rather use a vehicle maintained by a professional than by a muppet like me! </p><p>Let&rsquo;s recap our options. We can balance fluctuating demand and fluctu- ating supply by switching on and off power <em>generators</em> (waste incinerators and hydroelectric stations, for example); by <em>storing</em> energy somewhere and regenerating it when it&rsquo;s needed; or by switching <em>demand</em> off and on. </p><p>The most promising of these options, in terms of scale, is switching on and off the power demand of electric-vehicle charging. 30 million cars, with 40 kWh of associated batteries each (some of which might be ex- changeable batteries sitting in filling stations) adds up to 1200 GWh. If freight delivery were electrified too then the total storage capacity would be bigger still. </p><p>There is thus a beautiful match between wind power and electric vehicles. If we ramp up electric vehicles at the same time as ramping up wind power, roughly 3000 new vehicles for every 3 MW wind turbine, and if we ensure that the charging systems for the vehicles are smart, this synergy would go a long way to solving the problem of wind fluctuations. If my prediction about hydrogen vehicles is wrong, and hydrogen vehicles turn out to be the low-energy vehicles of the future, then the wind-with-electric- vehicles match-up that I&rsquo;ve just described could of course be replaced by a wind-with-hydrogen match-up. The wind turbines would make electricity; and whenever electricity was plentiful, hydrogen would be produced and stored in tanks, for subsequent use in vehicles or in other applications, </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">such as glass production. </p><h2>Other demand-management and storage ideas</h2><p class="first">There are a few other demand-management and energy-storage options, which we&rsquo;ll survey now. </p><p>The idea of modifying the rate of production of stuff to match the power of a renewable source is not new. Many aluminium production plants are located close to hydroelectric power stations; the more it rains, the more aluminium is produced. Wherever power is used to create stuff that is storable, there&rsquo;s potential for switching that power-demand on and off in a smart way. For example, reverse-osmosis systems (which make pure water from sea-water &ndash; see p92) are major power consumers in many countries (though not Britain). Another storable product is heat. If, as sug- gested in Chapter 21, we electrify buildings&rsquo; heating and cooling systems, especially water-heating and air-heating, then there&rsquo;s potential for lots of easily-turn-off-and-onable power demand to be attached to the grid. Well- insulated buildings hold their heat for many hours, so there&rsquo;s flexibility in the timing of their heating. Moreover, we could include large thermal reservoirs in buildings, and use heat-pumps to pump heat into or out of those reservoirs at times of electricity abundance; then use a second set of heat pumps to deliver heat or cold from the reservoirs to the places where heating or cooling are wanted. </p><p>Controlling electricity demand automatically would be easy. The simp- lest way to do this is to have devices such as fridges and freezers listen to the frequency of the mains. When there is a shortage of power on the grid, the frequency drops below its standard value of 50 Hz; when there is a power excess, the frequency rises above 50 Hz. (It&rsquo;s just like a dynamo on a bicycle: when you switch the lights on, you have to pedal harder to supply the extra power; if you don&rsquo;t then the bike goes a bit slower.) Fridges can be modified to nudge their internal thermostats up and down just a little in response to the mains frequency, in such a way that, without ever jeopardizing the temperature of your butter, they tend to take power at times that help the grid. </p><p>Can demand-management provide a significant chunk of virtual storage? How big a sink of power are the nation&rsquo;s fridges? On average, a typical fridge-freezer draws about 18 W; let&rsquo;s guess that the number of fridges is about 30million. So the ability to switch off all the nation&rsquo;s fridges for a few minutes would be equivalent to 0.54 GW of automatic ad- justable power. This is quite a lot of electrical power &ndash; more than 1% of the national total &ndash; and it is similar in size to the sudden increases in demand produced when the people, united in an act of religious observance (such as watching EastEnders), simultaneously switch on their kettles. Such &ldquo;TV pick-ups&rdquo; typically produce increases of demand of 0.6&ndash;0.8 GW. Auto- matically switching off every fridge would <em>nearly</em> cover these daily blips </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">of concerted kettle boiling. These smart fridges could also help iron out short-time-scale fluctuations in wind power. The TV pick-ups associated with the holiest acts of observance (for example, watching England play footie against Sweden) can produce sudden increases in demand of over 2 GW. On such occasions, electricity demand and supply are kept in balance by unleashing the full might of Dinorwig. </p><p>To provide flexibility to the electricity-grid&rsquo;s managers, who perpetually turn power stations up and down to match supply to demand, many industrial users of electricity are on special contracts that allow the managers to switch off those users&rsquo; demand at very short notice. In South Africa (where there are frequent electricity shortages), radio-controlled demand-management systems are being installed in hundreds of thousands of homes, to control air-conditioning systems and electric water heaters. </p><h3>Denmark&rsquo;s solution</h3><p class="first">Here&rsquo;s how Denmark copes with the intermittency of its wind power. The Danes effectively pay to use other countries&rsquo; hydroelectric facilities as stor- age facilities. Almost all of Denmark&rsquo;s wind power is exported to its European neighbours, some of whom have hydroelectric power, which they can turn down to balance things out. The saved hydroelectric power is then sold back to the Danes (at a higher price) during the next period of low wind and high demand. Overall, Danish wind is contributing useful energy, and the system as a whole has considerable security thanks to the capacity of the hydro system. </p><p>Could Britain adopt the Danish solution? We would need direct large- capacity connections to countries with lots of turn-off-and-on-able hydro- electric capacity; or a big connection to a Europe-wide electricity grid. </p><p>Norway has 27.5 GW of hydroelectric capacity. Sweden has roughly 16 GW. And Iceland has 1.8 GW. A 1.2 GW high-voltage DC interconnector to Norway was mooted in 2003, but not built. A connection to the Netherlands &ndash; the BritNed interconnector, with a capacity of 1 GW &ndash; will be built in 2010. Denmark&rsquo;s wind capacity is 3.1 GW, and it has a 1 GW connection to Norway, 0.6 GW to Sweden, and 1.2 GW to Germany, a total export capacity of 2.8 GW, very similar to its wind capacity. To be able to export all its excess wind power in the style of Denmark, Britain (assuming 33 GW of wind capacity) would need something like a 10 GW connection to Norway, 8 GW to Sweden, and 1 GW to Iceland. </p><h3>A solution with two grids</h3><p class="first">A radical approach is to put wind power and other intermittent sources onto a separate <em>second</em> electricity grid, used to power systems that don&rsquo;t re- quire reliable power, such as heating and electric vehicle battery-charging. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:34em"><img src="figure221.png" width="212" height="219" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.12</span>. Electrical production and consumption on Fair Isle, 1995&ndash;96. All numbers are in kWh/d per person. Production exceeds consumption because 0.6 kWh/d per person were dumped</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">For over 25 years (since 1982), the Scottish island of Fair Isle (population 70, area 5.6 km<sup>2</sup>) has had two electricity networks that distribute power from two wind turbines and, if necessary, a diesel-powered electricity generator. Standard electricity service is provided on one network, and electric heating is delivered by a second set of cables. The electric heating is mainly served by excess electricity from the wind-turbines that would otherwise have had to be dumped. Remote frequency-sensitive programmable relays control individual water heaters and storage heaters in the individual buildings of the community. The mains frequency is used to inform heaters when they may switch on. In fact there are up to six frequency channels per household, so the system emulates seven grids. Fair Isle also successfully trialled a kinetic-energy storage system (a flywheel) to store energy during fluctuations of wind strength on a time-scale of 20 seconds. </p><h3>Electrical vehicles as generators</h3><p class="first">If 30 million electric vehicles were willing, in times of national electricity shortage, to run their chargers in reverse and put power back into the grid, then, at 2 kW per vehicle, we&rsquo;d have a potential power source of 60 GW &ndash; similar to the capacity of all the power stations in the country. Even if only one third of the vehicles were connected and available at one time, they&rsquo;d still amount to a potential source of 20 GW of power. If each of those vehicles made an emergency donation of 2 kWh of energy &ndash; corresponding to perhaps 20% of its battery&rsquo;s energy-storage capacity &ndash; then the total energy provided by the fleet would be 20 GWh &ndash; twice as much as the energy in the Dinorwig pumped storage facility. </p><h3>Other storage technologies</h3><p class="first">There are lots of ways to store energy, and lots of criteria by which storage solutions are judged. Figure 26.13 shows three of the most important criteria: energy density (how much energy is stored per kilogram of storage system); efficiency (how much energy you get back per unit energy put in); and lifetime (how many cycles of energy storage can be delivered before the system needs refurbishing). Other important criteria are: the maximum rate at which energy can be pumped into or out of the storage system, often expressed as a power per kg; the duration for which energy stays stored in the system; and of course the cost and safety of the system. </p><h5>Flywheels</h5><p class="first">Figure 26.15 shows a monster flywheel used to supply brief bursts of power of up to 0.4 GW to power an experimental facility. It weighs 800 t. Spinning at 225 revolutions per minute, it can store 1000 kWh, and its en- ergy density is about 1 Wh per kg. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:37em"><img src="figure222.png" width="219" height="190" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.15</span>.

This storage system is a big &ldquo;flow battery,&rdquo; a redox regenerative fuel cell, with a couple of tanks full of vanadium in different chemical states. This storage system can smooth the output of its wind farm on a time-scale of minutes, but the longest time for which it could deliver one third of the capacity (during a lull in the wind) is one hour. </p><p>A 1.5 MWh vanadium system costing $480 000 occupies 70 m<sup>2</sup> with a mass of 107 tons. The vanadium redox battery has a life of more than 10 000 cycles. It can be charged at the same rate that it is discharged (in contrast to lead-acid batteries which must be charged 5 times as slowly). Its efficiency is 70&ndash;75%, round-trip. The volume required is about 1 m<sup>3</sup> of 2-molar vanadium in sulphuric acid to store 20 kWh. (That&rsquo;s 20 Wh/kg.) </p><p>So to store 10 GWh would require 500 000 m<sup>3</sup> (170 swimming pools) &ndash; for example, tanks 2 m high covering a floor area of 500 m &times; 500 m. </p><p>Scaling up the vanadium technology to match a big pumped-storage system &ndash; 10 GWh &ndash; might have a noticeable effect on the world vanadium market, but there is no long-term shortage of vanadium. Current worldwide production of vanadium is 40 000 tons per year. A 10 GWh system would contain 36 000 tons of vanadium &ndash; about one year&rsquo;s worth of current production. Vanadium is currently produced as a by-product of other pro- cesses, and the total world vanadium resource is estimated to be 63 million tons. </p><h3>&ldquo;Economical&rdquo; solutions</h3><p class="first">In the present world which doesn&rsquo;t put any cost on carbon pollution, the financial bar that a storage system must beat is an ugly alternative: storage can be emulated by simply putting up an extra gas-fired power station to meet extra demand, and shedding any excess electrical power by throwing it away in heaters. </p><h2>Seasonal fluctuations</h2><p class="first">The fluctuations of supply and demand that have the longest timescale are seasonal. The most important fluctuation is that of building-heating, which goes up every winter. Current UK natural gas demand varies throughout the year, from a typical average of 36 kWh/d per person in July and August to an average of 72 kWh/d per person in December to February, with extremes of 30&ndash;80 kWh/d/p (figure 26.16). </p><p>Some renewables also have yearly fluctuations &ndash; solar power is stronger in summer and wind power is weaker. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:33em"><img src="figure223.png" width="212" height="248" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 26.16</span>.

Electric vehicles and pumped storage are not going to help store the sort of quantities required. A useful technology will surely be long-term thermal storage.

And the plan needs to add up. The plan also needs a political and financial roadmap. Politics and economics are not part of this book&rsquo;s brief, so here I will simply discuss what the technical side of a plan that adds up might look like. </p><p>There are many plans that add up. In this chapter I will describe five. Please don&rsquo;t take any of the plans I present as &ldquo;the author&rsquo;s recommended solution.&rdquo; My sole recommendation is this: </p><blockquote><p>Make sure your policies include a plan that adds up! </p></blockquote><p>Each plan has a consumption side and a production side: we have to specify how much power our country will be consuming, and how that power is to be produced. To avoid the plans&rsquo; taking many pages, I deal with a cartoon of our country, in which we consume power in just three forms: transport, heating, and electricity. This is a drastic simplification, omitting industry, farming, food, imports, and so forth. But I hope it&rsquo;s a helpful simplification, allowing us to compare and contrast alternative plans in one minute. Eventually we&rsquo;ll need more detailed plans, but today, we are so far from our destination that I think a simple cartoon is the best way to capture the issues. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll present a few plans that I believe are technically feasible for the UK by 2050. All will share the same consumption side. I emphasize again, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that I think this is the correct plan for consumption, or the only plan. I just want to avoid overwhelming you with a proliferation of plans. On the production side, I will describe a range of plans using different mixes of renewables, &ldquo;clean coal,&rdquo; and nuclear power. </p><h2>The current situation</h2><p>The current situation in our cartoon country is as follows. Transport (of both humans and stuff) uses 40 kWh/d per person. Most of that energy is currently consumed as petrol, diesel, or kerosene. Heating of air and water uses 40 kWh/d per person. Much of that energy is currently provided by natural gas. Delivered electricity amounts to 18 kWh/d/p and uses fuel (mainly coal, gas, and nuclear) with an energy content of 45 kWh/d/p. The remaining 27 kWh/d/p goes up cooling towers (25 kWh/d/p) and is lost in the wires of the distribution network (2 kWh/d/p). The total energy input to this present-day cartoon country is 125 kWh/d per person. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img src="figure226.png" width="437" height="537" alt=""><h2>Common features of all five plans</h2><p class="first">In my future cartoon country, the energy consumption is reduced by using more efficient technology for transport and heating. </p><p>In the five plans for the future, transport is largely electrified. Electric engines are more efficient than petrol engines, so the energy required for transport is reduced. Public transport (also largely electrified) is better integrated, better personalized, and better patronized. I&rsquo;ve assumed that electrification makes transport about four times more efficient, and that economic growth cancels out some of these savings, so that the net effect is a halving of energy consumption for transport. There are a few essential vehicles that can&rsquo;t be easily electrified, and for those we make our own liquid fuels (for example biodiesel or biomethanol or cellulosic </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.1</span>. Current consumption per person in &ldquo;cartoon Britain 2008&rdquo; (left two columns), and a future consumption plan, along with a possible breakdown of fuels (right two columns). This plan requires that electricity supply be increased from 18 to 48 kWh/d per person of electricity.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">bioethanol). The energy for transport is 18 kWh/d/p of electricity and 2 kWh/d/p of liquid fuels. The electric vehicles&rsquo; batteries serve as an energy storage facility, helping to cope with fluctuations of electricity supply and demand. The area required for the biofuel production is about 12% of the UK (500 m<sup>2</sup> per person), assuming that biofuel production comes from 1%-efficient plants and that conversion of plant to fuel is 33% efficient. Alternatively, the biofuels could be imported if we could persuade other countries to devote the required (Wales-sized) area of agricultural land to biofuels for us. </p><p>In all five plans, the energy consumption of <strong>heating</strong> is reduced by im- proving the insulation of all buildings, and improving the control of tem- perature (through thermostats, education, and the promotion of sweater- wearing by sexy personalities). New buildings (all those built from 2010 onwards) are really well insulated and require almost no space heating. Old buildings (which will still dominate in 2050) are mainly heated by air- source heat pumps and ground-source heat pumps. Some water heating is delivered by solar panels (2.5 square metres on every house), some by heat pumps, and some by electricity. Some buildings located near to managed forests and energy-crop plantations are heated by biomass. The power re- quired for heating is thus reduced from 40 kWh/d/p to 12 kWh/d/p of electricity, 2 kWh/d/p<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#205><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> of solar hot water, and 5 kWh/d/p of wood. </p><p>The wood for making heat (or possibly combined heat and power) comes from nearby forests and energy crops (perhaps miscanthus grass, willow, or poplar) covering a land area of 30 000 km<sup>2</sup>, or 500 m<sup>2</sup> per person; this corresponds to 18% of the UK&rsquo;s agricultural land, which has an area of 2800 m<sup>2</sup> per person. The energy crops are grown mainly on the lower- grade land, leaving the higher-grade land for food-farming. Each 500 m<sup>2</sup> of energy crops yields 0.5 oven dry tons per year, which has an energy content of about 7 kWh/d; of this power, about 30% is lost in the process of heat production and delivery. The final heat delivered is 5 kWh/d per person. </p><p>In these plans, I assume the current demand for <strong>electricity</strong> for gadgets, light, and so forth is maintained. So we still require 18 kWh(e)/d/p of electricity. Yes, lighting efficiency is improved by a switch to light-emitting diodes for most lighting, and many other gadgets will get more efficient; but thanks to the blessings of economic growth, we&rsquo;ll have increased the number of gadgets in our lives &ndash; for example video-conferencing systems to help us travel less. </p><p>The total consumption of electricity under this plan goes up (because of the 18 kWh/d/p for electric transport and the 12 kWh/d/p for heat pumps) to 48 kWh/d/p (or 120 GW nationally). This is nearly a tripling of UK electricity consumption. Where&rsquo;s that energy to come from? Let&rsquo;s describe some alternatives. Not all of these alternatives are &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; as defined in this book; but they are all low-carbon plans. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h2>Producing lots of electricity &ndash; the components</h2><p class="first">To make lots of electricity, each plan uses some amount of onshore and off- shore wind; some solar photovoltaics; possibly some solar power bought from countries with deserts; waste incineration (including refuse and agri- cultural waste); hydroelectricity (the same amount as we get today); perhaps wave power; tidal barrages, tidal lagoons, and tidal stream power; perhaps nuclear power; and perhaps some &ldquo;clean fossil fuel,&rdquo; that is, coal burnt in power stations that do carbon capture and storage. Each plan aims for a total electricity production of 50 kWh/d/p on average &ndash; I got this figure by rounding up the 48 kWh/d/p of average demand, allowing for some loss in the distribution network. </p><p>Some of the plans that follow will import power from other countries. For comparison, it may be helpful to know how much of our current power is imported today. The answer is that, in 2006, the UK imported 28 kWh/d/p of fuel &ndash; 23% of its primary consumption. These imports are dominated by coal (18 kWh/d/p), crude oil (5 kWh/d/p), and natural gas (6 kWh/d/p). Nuclear fuel (uranium) is not usually counted as an import since it&rsquo;s easily stored. </p><p>In all five plans I will assume that we scale up municipal waste in- cineration so that almost all waste that can&rsquo;t usefully be recycled is in- cinerated rather than landfilled. Incinerating 1 kg per day per person of waste yields roughly 0.5 kWh/d per person of electricity. I&rsquo;ll assume that a similar amount of agricultural waste is also incinerated, yielding 0.6 kWh/d/p. Incinerating this waste requires roughly 3 GW of waste-to- energy capacity, a ten-fold increase over the incinerating power stations of 2008 (figure 27.2). London (7 million people) would have twelve 30-MW waste-to-energy plants like the SELCHP plant in South London (see p 287). Birmingham (1 million people) would have two of them. Every town of 200 000 people would have a 10 MW waste-to-energy plant. Any fears that waste incineration at this scale would be difficult, dirty, or dangerous should be allayed by figure 27.3, which shows that many countries in Europe incinerate <em>far</em> more waste per person than the UK; these incineration-loving countries include Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland &ndash; not usually nations associated with hygiene problems! One good side-effect of this waste incineration plan is that it eliminates future methane emissions from landfill sites. </p><p>In all five plans, hydroelectricity contributes 0.2 kWh/d/p, the same as today. </p><p>Electric vehicles are used as a dynamically-adjustable load on the elec- tricity network. The average power required to charge the electric vehicles is 45 GW (18 kWh/d/p). So fluctuations in renewables such as solar and wind can be balanced by turning up and down this load, as long as the fluctuations are not too big or lengthy. Daily swings in electricity demand are going to be bigger than they are today because of the replacement of </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure228.png" width="218" height="387" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.2</span>. Waste-to-energy facilities in Britain. The line shows the average power production assuming 1 kg of waste &rarr; 0.5 kWh of electricity.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img style="padding:2em 0 2em 0" src="figure227.png" width="699" height="394" alt=""><p class="first">gas for cooking and heating by electricity (see figure 26.16, p200). To ensure that surges in demand of 10 GW lasting up to 5 hours can be covered, all the plans would build five new pumped storage facilities like Dinorwig (or upgrade hydroelectric facilities to provide pumped storage). 50 GWh of storage is equal to five Dinorwigs, each with a capacity of 2 GW. Some of the plans that follow will require extra pumped storage beyond this. For additional insurance, all the plans would build an electricity interconnector to Norway, with a capacity of 2 GW. </p><h2>Producing lots of electricity &ndash; plan D</h2><p class="first">Plan D (&ldquo;D&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;domestic diversity&rdquo;) uses a lot of every possible domestic source of electricity, and depends relatively little on energy supply from other countries. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s where plan D gets its 50 kWh/d/p of electricity from. Wind: 8 kWh/d/p (20 GW average; 66 GW peak) (plus about 400 GWh of assoc- iated pumped storage facilities). Solar PV: 3 kWh/d/p. Waste incineration: 1.3<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#207><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> kWh/d/p. Hydroelectricity: 0.2 kWh/d/p. Wave: 2 kWh/d/p. Tide: 3.7 kWh/d/p. Nuclear: 16 kWh/d/p (40 GW). &ldquo;Clean coal&rdquo;: 16 kWh/d/p (40 GW). </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.3</span>. Left: Municipal solid waste put into landfill, versus amount incinerated, in kg per day per person, by country. Right: Amount of waste recycled versus amount landfilled or incinerated. Percentage of waste recycled is given beside each country&rsquo;s name.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p>To get 8 kWh/d/p of wind requires a 30-fold increase in wind power over the installed power in 2008. Britain would have nearly 3 times as much wind hardware as Germany has now. Installing this much windpower offshore over a period of 10 years would require roughly 50 jack-up barges. </p><p>Getting 3 kWh/d/p from solar photovoltaics requires 6 m<sup>2</sup> of 20%- efficient panels per person. Most south-facing roofs would have to be completely covered with panels; alternatively, it might be more economical, and cause less distress to the League for the Preservation of Old Buildings, to plant many of these panels in the countryside in the traditional Bavarian manner (figure 6.7, p41). </p><p>The waste incineration corresponds to 1 kg per day per person of domes- tic waste (yielding 0.5 kWh/d/p) and a similar amount of agricultural waste yielding 0.6 kWh/d/p; the hydroelectricity is 0.2 kWh/d/p, the same amount as we get from hydro today. </p><p>The wave power requires 16 000 Pelamis deep-sea wave devices occu- pying 830 km of Atlantic coastline (see the map on p73). The tide power comes from 5 GW of tidal stream installations, a 2 GW Severn barrage, and 2.5 GW of tidal lagoons, which can serve as pumped storage systems too. </p><p>To get 16 kWh/d/p of nuclear power requires 40 GW of nukes, which is a roughly four-fold increase of the 2007 nuclear fleet. If we produced 16 kWh/d/p of nuclear power, we&rsquo;d lie between Belgium, Finland, France and Sweden, in terms of per-capita production: Belgium and Finland each produce roughly 12 kWh/d/p; France and Sweden produce 19 kWh/d/p and 20 kWh/d/p respectively. </p><p>To get 16 kWh/d/p of &ldquo;clean coal&rdquo; (40 GW), we would have to take the current fleet of coal stations, which deliver about 30 GW, retrofit carbon- capture systems to them, which would reduce their output to 22 GW, then build another 18 GW of new clean-coal stations. This level of coal power requires an energy input of about 53 kWh/d/p of coal, which is a little big- ger than the total rate at which we currently burn <em>all</em> fossil fuels at power stations, and well above the level we estimated as being &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; in Chapter 23. This rate of consumption of coal is roughly three times the current rate of coal imports (18 kWh/d/p). If we didn&rsquo;t reopen UK coal mines, this plan would have 32% of UK electricity depending on imported coal. Reopened UK coal mines could deliver an energy input of about 8 kWh/d/p, so either way, the UK would not be self-sufficient for coal. </p><p>Do any features of this plan strike you as unreasonable or objectionable? If so, perhaps one of the next four plans is more to your liking. </p><h2>Producing lots of electricity &ndash; plan N</h2><p class="first">Plan N is the &ldquo;NIMBY&rdquo; plan, for people who don&rsquo;t like industrializing the British countryside with renewable energy facilities, and who don&rsquo;t want </p><div class="imgcap"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure229.png" width="101" height="368" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.4.</span> Plan D</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">new nuclear power stations either. Let&rsquo;s reveal the plan in stages. </p><p>First, we turn down all the renewable knobs from their very high set- tings in plan D to: wind: 2 kWh/d/p (5 GW average); solar PV: 0; wave: 0; tide: 1 kWh/d/p. </p><p>We&rsquo;ve just lost ourselves 14 kWh/d/p (35 GW nationally) by turning down the renewables. (Don&rsquo;t misunderstand! Wind is still eight-fold increased over its 2008 levels.) </p><p>In the NIMBY plan, we reduce the contribution of nuclear power to 10 kWh/d/p (25 GW) &ndash; a reduction by 15 GW compared to plan D, but still a substantial increase over today&rsquo;s levels. 25 GW of nuclear power could, I think, be squeezed onto the existing nuclear sites, so as to avoid imposing on any new back yards. I left the clean-coal contribution unchanged at 16 kWh/d/p (40 GW). The electricity contributions of hydroelectricity and waste incineration remain the same as in plan D. </p><p>Where are we going to get an extra 50 GW from? The NIMBY says, &ldquo;not in my back yard, but in someone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Thus the NIMBY plan pays other countries for imports of solar power from their deserts to the tune of 20 kWh/d/p (50 GW). </p><p>This plan requires the creation of five blobs each the size of London (44 km in diameter) in the transmediterranean desert, filled with solar power stations. It also requires power transmission systems to get 50 GW of power up to the UK. Today&rsquo;s high voltage electricity connection from France can deliver only 2 GW of power. So this plan requires a 25-fold increase in the capacity of the electricity connection from the continent. (Or an equivalent power-transport solution &ndash; perhaps ships filled with methanol or boron plying their way from desert shores.) </p><p>Having less wind power, plan N doesn&rsquo;t need to build in Britain the extra pumped-storage facilities mentioned in plan D, but given its depen- dence on sunshine, it still requires storage systems to be built somewhere to store energy from the fluctuating sun. Molten salt storage systems at the solar power stations are one option. Tapping into pumped storage systems in the Alps might also be possible. Converting the electricity to a storable fuel such as methanol is another option, though conversions entail losses and thus require more solar power stations. </p><p>This plan gets 32% + 40% = 72% of the UK&rsquo;s electricity from other countries. </p><h2>Producing lots of electricity &ndash; plan L</h2><p class="first">Some people say &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want nuclear power!&rdquo; How can we satisfy them? Perhaps it should be the job of this anti-nuclear bunch to persuade the NIMBY bunch that they do want renewable energy in our back yard after all. </p><p>We can create a nuclear-free plan by taking plan D, keeping all those renewables in our back yard, and doing a straight swap of nuclear for </p><div class="imgcap"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure230.png" width="109" height="368" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.5.</span> Plan N</div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:30em"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure231.png" width="101" height="368" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.6.</span> Plan L</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">desert power. As in plan N, the delivery of desert power requires a large increase in transmission systems between North Africa and Britain; the Europe&ndash;UK interconnectors would need to be increased from 2 GW to at least 40 GW. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s where plan L gets its 50 kWh/d/p of electricity from. Wind: 8 kWh/d/p (20 GW average) (plus about 400 GWh of associated pumped storage facilities). Solar PV: 3 kWh/d/p. Hydroelectricity and waste in- cineration: 1.3 kWh/d/p. Wave: 2 kWh/d/p. Tide: 3.7 kWh/d/p. &ldquo;Clean coal&rdquo;: 16 kWh/d/p (40 GW). Solar power in deserts: 16 kWh/d/p (40 GW average power). </p><p>This plan imports 64% of UK electricity from other countries. </p><p>I call this &ldquo;plan L&rdquo; because it aligns fairly well with the policies of the Liberal Democrats &ndash; at least it did when I first wrote this chapter in mid- 2007; recently, they&rsquo;ve been talking about &ldquo;real energy independence for the UK,&rdquo; and have announced a zero-carbon policy, under which Britain would be a net energy <em>exporter</em>; their policy does not detail how these targets would be met. </p><h2>Producing lots of electricity &ndash; plan G</h2><p class="first">Some people say &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want nuclear power, <em>and</em> we don&rsquo;t want coal!&rdquo; It sounds a desirable goal, but we need a plan to deliver it. I call this &ldquo;plan G,&rdquo; because I guess the Green Party don&rsquo;t want nuclear or coal, though I think not all Greens would like the rest of the plan. Greenpeace, I know, <em>love</em> wind, so plan G is dedicated to them too, because it has <em>lots</em> of wind. </p><p>I make plan G by starting again from plan D, nudging up the wave contribution by 1 kWh/d/p (by pumping money into wave research and increasing the efficiency of the Pelamis converter) and bumping up wind power fourfold (relative to plan D) to 32 kWh/d/p, so that wind delivers 64% of all the electricity. This is a 120-fold increase of British wind power over today&rsquo;s levels. Under this plan, <em>world</em> wind power in 2008 is multiplied by 4, with all of the increase being placed on or around the British Isles. </p><p>The immense dependence of plan G on renewables, especially wind, creates difficulties for our main method of balancing supply and demand, namely adjusting the charging rate of millions of rechargeable batteries for transport. So in plan G we have to include substantial additional pumped- storage facilities, capable of balancing out the fluctuations in wind on a timescale of days. Pumped-storage facilities equal to 400 Dinorwigs can completely replace wind for a national lull lasting 2 days. Roughly 100 of Britain&rsquo;s major lakes and lochs would be required for the associated pumped-storage systems. </p><p>Plan G&rsquo;s electricity breaks down as follows. Wind: 32 kWh/d/p (80 GW average) (plus about 4000 GWh of associated pumped-storage facilities). Solar photovoltaics: 3 kWh/d/p. Hydroelectricity and waste incineration: </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:27em"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure232.png" width="102" height="368" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.7.</span> Plan G</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">1.3 kWh/d/p.

On a level economic playing field with a strong price signal preventing the emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, we don&rsquo;t expect a diverse solution with a wide range of power- costs; rather, we expect an economically optimal solution that delivers the required power at the lowest cost. And when &ldquo;clean coal&rdquo; and nuclear go head to head on price, it&rsquo;s nuclear that wins. (Engineers at a UK electricity generator told me that the capital cost of regular dirty coal power stations is &pound;1 billion per GW, about the same as nuclear; but the capital cost of &ldquo;clean-coal&rdquo; power, including carbon capture and storage, is roughly &pound;2 billion per GW.) I&rsquo;ve assumed that solar power in other people&rsquo;s deserts loses to nuclear power when we take into account the cost of the required 2000-km-long transmission lines (though van Voorthuysen (2008) reckons that with Nobel-prize-worthy developments in solar-powered production of chemical fuels, solar power in deserts would be the economic equal of nuclear power). Offshore wind also loses to nuclear, but I&rsquo;ve assumed that onshore wind costs about the same as nuclear. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s where plan E gets its 50 kWh/d/p of electricity from. Wind: 4 kWh/d/p (10 GW average). Solar PV: 0. Hydroelectricity and waste incineration: 1.3 kWh/d/p. Wave: 0. Tide: 0.7 kWh/d/p. And nuclear: 44 kWh/d/p (110 GW). </p><p>This plan has a ten-fold increase in our nuclear power over 2007 levels. Britain would have 110 GW, which is roughly double France&rsquo;s nuclear fleet. I included a little tidal power because I believe a well-designed tidal lagoon facility can compete with nuclear power. </p><p>In this plan, Britain has no energy imports (except for the uranium, which, as we said before, is not conventionally counted as an import). </p><p>Figure 27.9 shows all five plans. </p><h2>How these plans relate to carbon-sucking and air travel</h2><p class="first">In a future world where carbon pollution is priced appropriately to prevent catastrophic climate change, we will be interested in any power scheme that can at low cost put extra carbon down a hole in the ground. Such carbon-neutralization schemes might permit us to continue flying at 2004 levels (while oil lasts). In 2004, average UK emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from flying were about 0.5 t CO<sub>2</sub> per year per person. Accounting for the full green- house impact of flying, perhaps the effective emissions were about 1 t CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person. Now, in all five of these plans I assumed that one </p><div class="imgcap"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure234.png" width="102" height="368" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"> <span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.8.</span> Plan E</div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:53em"><div class="sidebarcaption">1 t CO<sub>2</sub>e means greenhouse-gas emissions equivalent to one ton of CO<sub>2</sub>.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img style="padding-bottom:2em" src="figure233.png" width="539" height="394" alt=""><p class="first">eighth of the UK was devoted to the production of energy crops which were then used for heating or for combined heat and power. If instead we directed all these crops to power stations with carbon capture and storage &ndash; the &ldquo;clean-coal&rdquo; plants that featured in three of the plans &ndash; then the amount of extra CO<sub>2</sub> captured would be about 1 t of CO<sub>2</sub> per year per person. If the municipal and agricultural waste incinerators were located at clean-coal plants too so that they could share the same chimney, perhaps the total captured could be increased to 2 t CO<sub>2</sub> per year per person. This arrangement would have additional costs: the biomass and waste might have to be transported further; the carbon-capture process would require a significant fraction of the energy from the crops; and the lost building- heating would have to be replaced by more air-source heat pumps. But, if carbon-neutrality is our aim, it would be worth planning ahead by seeking to locate new clean-coal plants with waste incinerators in regions close to potential biomass plantations. </p><h2>&ldquo;All these plans are absurd!&rdquo;</h2><p class="first">If you don&rsquo;t like these plans, I&rsquo;m not surprised. I agree that there is something unpalatable about every one of them. Feel free to make another plan that is more to your liking. But make sure it adds up! </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:28em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 27.9.</span> All five plans.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p>Perhaps you will conclude that a viable plan has to involve less power consumption per capita.

This sixth plan lies roughly in the middle of the first five, so I call it plan M (figure 28.1). </p><p>The areas and rough costs of these facilities are shown in table 28.3. For simplicity, the financial costs are estimated using today&rsquo;s prices for comparable facilities, many of which are early prototypes. We can expect many of the prices to drop significantly. The rough costs given here are the building costs, and don&rsquo;t include running costs or decommissioning costs. The &ldquo;per person&rdquo; costs are found by dividing the total cost by 60 million. Please remember, this is not a book about economics &ndash; that would require another 400 pages! I&rsquo;m providing these cost estimates only to give a rough indication of the price tag we should expect to see on a plan that adds up. </p><p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that I am not advocating this particular plan &ndash; it includes several features that I, as dictator of Britain, would not select. I&rsquo;ve deliberately included all available technologies, so that you can try out your own plans with other mixes. </p><p>For example, if you say &ldquo;photovoltaics are going to be too expensive, I&rsquo;d like a plan with more wave power instead,&rdquo; you can see how to do it: you need to increase the wave farms eight-fold. If you don&rsquo;t like the wind farms&rsquo; locations, feel free to move them (but where to?). Bear in mind that putting more of them offshore will increase costs. If you&rsquo;d like fewer wind farms, no problem &ndash; just specify which of the other technologies you&rsquo;d like instead. You can replace five of the 100 km<sup>2</sup> wind farms by adding one more 1 GW nuclear power station, for example. </p><p>Perhaps you think that this plan (like each of the five plans in the previ- ous chapter) devotes unreasonably large areas to biofuels. Fine: you may therefore conclude that the demand for liquid fuels for transport must be reduced below the 2 kWh per day per person that this plan assumed; or that liquid fuels must be created in some other way. </p><h2>Cost of switching from fossil fuels to renewables</h2><p class="first">Every wind farm costs a few million pounds to build and delivers a few megawatts. As a very rough ballpark figure in 2008, installing one watt of capacity costs one pound; one kilowatt costs 1000 pounds; a megawatt of wind costs a million; a gigawatt of nuclear costs a billion or perhaps two. Other renewables are more expensive. We (the UK) currently consume a total power of roughly 300 GW, most of which is fossil fuel. So we can anticipate that a major switching from fossil fuel to renewables and/or nu- clear is going to require roughly 300 GW of renewables and/or nuclear and </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:7em"><img style="padding-left:3em" src="figure236.png" width="102" height="382" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 28.1.</span> Plan M</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><table id="p216framed" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary=""><tr><th></th><th>Capacity</th><th>Rough cost  <span class="mauve">total</span></th><th>  per person</th><th>Average power delivered</th></tr><tr><td class="pad0">52 onshore wind farms: <span class="darkblue">5200 km<sup>2</sup></span></td><td>35 GW</td><td><span class="mauve">&pound;27bn</span></td><td>&pound;450</td><td><span class="green">4.2 kWh/d/p</span></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td class="pad1" colspan="2"><span class="cellfooter p216small p216grey">&ndash;based on Lewis wind farm</span></td></tr><tr><td class="pad0">29 offshore wind farms: <span class="darkblue">2900 km<sup>2</sup></span></td><td>29 GW</td><td><span class="mauve">&pound;36bn</span></td><td>&pound;650</td><td><span class="green">3.5 kWh/d/p</span></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td class="pad1" style="line-height:120%" colspan="2"><span class="cellfooter p216small p216grey">&ndash; based on Kentish Flats, &amp; including &pound;3bn investment in jack-up barges.</span></td></tr><tr><td class="pad1">Pumped storage: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 facilities similar to Dinorwig</td><td>30 GW</td><td><span class="mauve">&pound;15bn</span></td><td>&pound;250</td></tr><tr><td class="pad0">Photovoltaic farms: <span class="darkblue">1000 km<sup>2</sup></span></td><td>48 GW</td><td><span class="mauve">&pound;190bn</span></td><td>&pound;3200</td><td><span class="green">2 kWh/d/p</span></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td class="pad1" style="line-height:120%" colspan="2"><span class="cellfooter p216small p216grey">&ndash; based on Solarpark in Bavaria</span></td></tr><tr><td class="pad1">Solar hot water panels: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 m<sup>2</sup> of roof-mounted panel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per person.

The rough costs in table 28.3 add up to &pound;870 bn, with the solar power facilities dominating the total &ndash; the photovoltaics cost &pound;190 bn and the concentrating solar stations cost &pound;340 bn. Both these costs might well come down dramatically as we learn by doing. A government report leaked by the Guardian in August 2007 estimates that achieving &ldquo;20% by 2020&rdquo; (that is, 20% of all energy from renewables, which would require an increase in renewable power of 80 GW) could cost &ldquo;up to &pound;22 billion&rdquo; (which would average out to &pound;1.7 billion per year). Even though this estimate is smaller than the &pound;80 billion that the rule of thumb I just mentioned would have suggested, the authors of the leaked report seem to view &pound;22 billion as an &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; cost, preferring a target of just 9% renewables. (Another reason they give for disliking the &ldquo;20% by 2020&rdquo; target is that the resulting greenhouse gas savings &ldquo;risk making the EU emissions trading scheme redundant.&rdquo; Terrifying thought!) </p><h2>Other things that cost a billion</h2><p class="first">Billions are big numbers and hard to get a feel for. To try to help put the cost of kicking fossil fuels into perspective, let&rsquo;s now list some other things that also come in billions of pounds, or in billions per year. I&rsquo;ll also express many of these expenditures &ldquo;per person,&rdquo; dividing the total by an appropriate population. </p><p>Perhaps the most relevant quantity to compare with is the money we <em>already</em> spend on energy every year. In the UK, the money spent on energy by final users is &pound;75 billion per year, and the total market value of all energy consumed is &pound;130 billion per year. So the idea of spending &pound;1.7 billion per year on investment in future energy infrastructure seems not at all unreasonable &ndash; it is less than 3% of our current expenditure on energy! </p><p>Another good comparison to make is with our annual expenditure on insurance: some of the investments we need to make offer an uncertain return &ndash; just like insurance.

Carbon sequestration companies are not thriving, even though the advice from climate experts and economic experts alike is that sucking carbon dioxide from thin air will very probably be necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. Carbon is not even being captured at any coal power stations (except for one tiny prototype in Germany). </p><p class="first">Why not?</p><p>The principal problem is that carbon pollution is not priced correctly. And there is no confidence that it&rsquo;s going to be priced correctly in the future. When I say &ldquo;correctly,&rdquo; I mean that the price of emitting carbon dioxide should be big enough such that every running coal power station has carbon capture technology fitted to it. </p><p>Solving climate change is a complex topic, but in a single crude brush- stroke, here is the solution: the price of carbon dioxide must be such that people <em>stop burning coal without capture</em>. Most of the solution is captured in this one brush-stroke because, in the long term, coal is the big fossil fuel. (Trying to reduce emissions from oil and gas is of secondary importance because supplies of both oil and gas are expected to decline over the next 50 years.) </p><p>So what do politicians need to do? They need to ensure that all coal power stations have carbon capture fitted. The first step towards this goal is for government to finance a large-scale demonstration project to sort out the technology for carbon capture and storage; second, politicians need to </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">enough to promote investment in alternatives to fossil fuels, and invest- ment in efficiency measures. Notice this is exactly the same policy as was suggested in the previous section. So, whether our motivation is fixing climate change, or ensuring security of supply, the policy outcome is the same: we need a carbon price that is stable and high. Figure 29.2 indicates very roughly the various carbon prices that are required to bring about various behaviour changes and investments; and the much lower prices charged by organizations that claim to &ldquo;offset&rdquo; greenhouse-gas emissions. How best to arrange a high carbon price? Is the European emissions trading scheme (figure 29.1) the way to go? This question lies in the domain of economists and international policy experts. The view of Cambridge economists Michael Grubb and David Newbery is that the European emis- sions trading scheme is not up to the job &ndash; &ldquo;current instruments will not deliver an adequate investment response.&rdquo; </p><p><em>The Economist</em> recommends a carbon tax as the primary mechanism for government support of clean energy sources. The Conservative Party&rsquo;s Quality of Life Policy Group also recommends increasing environmental taxes and reducing other taxes &ndash; &ldquo;a shift from <em>pay as you earn to pay as you burn</em>.&rdquo; The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution also says that the UK should introduce a carbon tax. &ldquo;It should apply upstream and cover all sectors.&rdquo; </p><p>So, there&rsquo;s clear support for a big carbon tax, accompanied by reductions in employment taxes, corporation taxes, and value-added taxes. But taxes and markets alone are not going to bring about all the actions needed. The tax-and-market approach fails if consumers sometimes choose irrat- ionally, if consumers value short-term cash more highly than long-term savings, or if the person choosing what to buy doesn&rsquo;t pay all the costs associated with their choice. </p><p>Indeed many brands are &ldquo;<em>reassuringly expensive</em>.&rdquo; Consumer choice is not determined solely by price signals. Many consumers care more about image and perception, and some deliberately buy expensive. </p><p>Once an inefficient thing is bought, it&rsquo;s too late. It&rsquo;s essential that inefficient things should not be manufactured in the first place; or that the consumer, when buying, should feel influenced not to buy inefficient things. </p><p>Here are some further examples of failures of the free market. </p><h3>The admission barrier</h3><p class="first">Imagine that carbon taxes are sufficiently high that a new super-duper low- carbon gizmo would cost 5% less than its long-standing high-carbon rival, the Dino-gizmo, <em>if</em> it were mass-produced in the same quantities. Thanks to clever technology, the Eco-gizmo&rsquo;s carbon emissions are a fantastic 90% lower than the Dino-gizmo&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s clear that it would be good for society if everyone bought Eco-gizmos now. But at the moment, sales of the new Eco-gizmo are low, so the per-unit economic costs are higher than the </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">Dino-gizmo&rsquo;s. Only a few tree-huggers and lab coats will buy the Eco- Gizmo, and Eco-Gizmo Inc. will go out of business. </p><p>Perhaps government interventions are necessary to oil the transition and give innovation a chance. Support for research and development? Tax- incentives favouring the new product (like the tax-incentives that oiled the transition from leaded to unleaded petrol)? </p><h3>The problem of small cost differences</h3><p class="first">Imagine that Eco-Gizmo Inc. makes it from tadpole to frog, and that carbon taxes are sufficiently high that an Eco-gizmo indeed costs 5% less than its long-standing high-carbon rival from Dino-appliances, Inc. Surely the carbon taxes will now do their job, and all consumers will buy the low- carbon gizmo? Ha! First, many consumers don&rsquo;t care too much about a 5% price difference. Image is everything. Second, if they feel at all threatened by the Eco-gizmo, Dino-appliances, Inc. will relaunch their Dino-gizmo, emphasizing that it&rsquo;s more patriotic, announcing that it&rsquo;s now available in green, and showing cool people sticking with the old faithful Dino-gizmo. &ldquo;Real men buy Dino-gizmos.&rdquo; If this doesn&rsquo;t work, Dino will issue press- releases saying scientists haven&rsquo;t ruled out the possibility that long-term use of the Eco-gizmo might cause cancer, highlighting the case of an old lady who was tripped up by an Eco-gizmo, or suggesting that Eco-gizmos harm the lesser spotted fruit bat. Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. As a backup plan, Dino-appliances could always buy up the Eco-gizmo company. The winning product will have nothing to do with energy saving if the economic incentive to the consumer is only 5%. </p><p>How to fix this problem? Perhaps government should simply ban the sales of the Dino-gizmo (just as it banned sales of leaded-petrol cars)? </p><h3>The problem of Larry and Tina</h3><p class="first">Imagine that Larry the landlord rents out a flat to Tina the tenant. Larry is responsible for maintaining the flat and providing the appliances in it, and Tina pays the monthly heating and electricity bills. Here&rsquo;s the problem: Larry feels no incentive to invest in modifications to the flat that would reduce Tina&rsquo;s bills. He could install more-efficient lightbulbs, and plug in a more economical fridge; these eco-friendly appliances would easily pay back their extra up-front cost over their long life; but it&rsquo;s Tina who would benefit, not Larry. Similarly, Larry feels little incentive to improve the flat&rsquo;s insulation or install double-glazing, especially when he takes into account the risk that Tina&rsquo;s boyfriend Wayne might smash one of the windows when drunk. In principle, in a perfect market, Larry and Tina would both make the &ldquo;right&rdquo; decisions: Larry would install all the energy-saving features, and would charge Tina a slightly higher monthly rent; Tina would recognize that the modern and well-appointed flat would be cheaper to live </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">in and would thus be happy to pay the higher rent; Larry would demand an increased deposit in case of breakage of the expensive new windows; and Tina would respond rationally and banish Wayne. However, I don&rsquo;t think that Larry and Tina can ever deliver a perfect market. Tina is poor, so has difficulty paying large deposits. Larry strongly wishes to rent out the flat, so Tina mistrusts his assurances about the property&rsquo;s low energy bills, suspecting Larry of exaggeration. </p><p>So some sort of intervention is required, to get Larry and Tina to do the right thing &ndash; for example, government could legislate a huge tax on inefficient appliances; ban from sale all fridges that do not meet economy benchmarks; require all flats to meet high standards of insulation; or in- troduce a system of mandatory independent flat assessment, so that Tina could read about the flat&rsquo;s energy profile before renting. </p><h2>Investment in research and development</h2><blockquote><p>We deplore the minimal amounts that the Government have committedto renewable-energy-related research and development (&pound;12.2 million in 2002-03). ... If resources other than wind are to be exploited in the United Kingdom this has to change. We could not avoid the conclusion that the Government are not taking energy problems sufficiently seriously.</p><cite>House of Lords Science and Technology Committee</cite></blockquote><blockquote><p>The absence of scientific understanding often leads to superficial decision- making. The 2003 energy white paper was a good example of that. I would not like publicly to call it amateurish but it did not tackle the problem in a realistic way.</p><cite>Sir David King, former Chief Scientist</cite></blockquote><blockquote><p>Serving on the government&rsquo;s Renewables Advisory Board ... felt like watching several dozen episodes of <span style="font-style:normal">Yes Minister</span> in slow motion. I do not think this government has ever been serious about renewables.</p><cite>Jeremy Leggett, founder of Solarcentury</cite></blockquote>I think the numbers speak for themselves. Just look at figure 28.5 (p218) and compare the billions spent on office refurbishments and military toys with the hundred-fold smaller commitment to renewable-energy-related research and development. It takes decades to develop renewable tech- nologies such as tidal stream power, concentrating solar power, and pho- tovoltaics. Nuclear fusion takes decades too. All these technologies need up-front support if they are going to succeed. </div>			     <div id="textcol"><table class="framed p230" summary=""><tr><th>Major action</th><th>possible saving</th></tr><tr><td>Eliminate draughts.</td><td>5 kWh/d</td></tr><tr><td>Double glazing.</td><td>10 kWh/d</td></tr><tr><td>Improve wall, roof, and floor insulation.</td><td>10 kWh/d</td></tr><tr><td>Solar hot water panels.</td><td>8 kWh/d</td></tr><tr><td>Photovoltaic panels.</td><td>5 kWh/d</td></tr><tr><td>Knock down old building and replace by new.</td><td>35 kWh/d</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>Replace fossil-fuel heating by ground-source or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air-source heat pumps.</td><td>10 kWh/d</td></tr></table><p>Finally, table 29.5 shows a few runners-up: some simple actions with small savings. </p><table class="framed p230" summary=""><tr><th>Action</th><th>possible saving</th></tr><tr><td>Wash laundry in cold water.</td><td>0.5 kWh/d</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>Stop using a tumble-dryer; use a clothes-line &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or airing cupboard.</td><td>0.5 kWh/d</td></tr></table><h2>Notes and further reading</h2><div class="endnote"><p>page no.</p><div class="notes"><p><span class="mark">222</span><em class="darkred">&ldquo;a bit impractical actually&quot;</em> The full transcript of the interview with Tony Blair (9 January 2007) is here [<span class="tinylink">2ykfgw</span>]. Here are some more quotes from it: <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Have you thought of perhaps not flying to Barbados for a holiday and not using all those air miles? <strong>Tony Blair</strong>: I would, frankly, be reluctant to give up my holidays abroad. <strong>Interviewer</strong>: It would send out a clear message though wouldn&rsquo;t it, if we didn&rsquo;t see that great big air journey off to the sunshine? ... &ndash; a holiday closer to home? <strong>Tony Blair</strong>: Yeah &ndash; but I personally think these things are a bit impractical actually to expect people to do that. I think that what we need to do is to look at how you make air travel more energy efficient, how you develop the new fuels that will allow us to burn less energy and emit less. How &ndash; for example &ndash; in the new frames for the aircraft, they are far more energy efficient. I know everyone always &ndash; people probably think the Prime Minister shouldn&rsquo;t go on holiday at all, but I think if what we do in this area is set people unrealistic targets, you know if we say to people we&rsquo;re going to cancel all the cheap air travel . . . You know, I&rsquo;m still waiting for the first politician who&rsquo;s actually running for office who&rsquo;s going to come out and say it &ndash; and they&rsquo;re not. The other quote: &ldquo;Unless we act now, not some time distant but now, these consequences, disastrous as they are, will be irreversible.

It is a widely held assumption that human development and growth are good things, so when sketching world plans for sustainable energy I am going to assume that all the countries with low GDP per capita are going to progress rightwards in figure 30.1. And as their GDPs increase, it&rsquo;s inevitable that their power consumptions will increase too. It&rsquo;s not clear what consumption we should plan for, but I think that the average European level (125 kWh per day per person) seems a reasonable assumption; alternatively, we could assume that efficiency measures, like those envisaged in Cartoon Britain in Chapters 19&ndash;28, allow all countries to attain a European standard of living with a lower power consumption. In the consumption plan on p204, Cartoon Britain&rsquo;s consumption fell to about <span class="red">68 kWh/d/p</span>. Bearing in mind that Cartoon Britain doesn&rsquo;t havemuch industrial activity, perhaps it would be sensible to assume a slightly higher target, such as Hong Kong&rsquo;s <span class="red">80 kWh/d/p</span>. </p><img style="padding-top:3em" src="figure242.png" width="480" height="438" alt=""><div class="imgcap" style="top:26em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 30.1.</span> Power consumption per capita versus GDP per capita, in purchasing-power-parity US dollars. Data from UNDP Human Development Report, 2007. Squares show countries having &ldquo;high human development;&rdquo; circles, &ldquo;medium&rdquo; or &ldquo;low.&rdquo; Both variables are on logarithmic scales. Figure 18.4 shows the same data on normal scales.</div></div></div><div id="textcol"><p class="first"><span class="green">2.6 kWh/d per person</span>. The Baltic and Mediterranean coastlines have no tidal resource worth talking of. </p><h3>Solar photovoltaics and thermal panels on roofs</h3><p class="first">Most places are sunnier than the UK, so solar panels would deliver more power in continental Europe. 10 m<sup>2</sup> of roof-mounted photovoltaic panels would deliver about 7 kWh/d in all places south of the UK. Similarly, 2 m<sup>2</sup> of water-heating panels could deliver on average 3.6 kWh/d of low-grade thermal heat. (I don&rsquo;t see much point in suggesting having more than 2 m<sup>2</sup> per person of water-heating panels, since this capacity would already be enough to saturate typical demand for hot water.) </p><h3>What else?</h3><p class="first">The total so far is 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;6.4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2.6&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;+&nbsp;3.6 = 30.6 kWh/d per person. The only resources not mentioned so far are geothermal power, and large-scale solar farming (with mirrors, panels, or biomass). </p><p>Geothermal power might work, but it&rsquo;s still in the research stages. I suggest treating it like fusion power: a good investment, but not to be relied on. </p><p>So what about solar farming? We could imagine using 5% of Europe (450 m<sup>2</sup> per person) for solar photovoltaic farms like the Bavarian one in figure 6.7 (which has a power density of 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>). This would deliver an average power of </p><p class="centrespaced">5 W/m<sup>2</sup> &times; 450 m<sup>2</sup> = <span class="green">54 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><p class="first">Solar PV farming would, therefore, add up to something substantial. The main problem with photovoltaic panels is their cost. Getting power during the winter is also a concern! </p><p>Energy crops? Plants capture only 0.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> (figure 6.11). Given that Europe needs to feed itself, the non-food energy contribution from plants in Europe can never be enormous. Yes, there will be some oil-seed rape here and some forestry there, but I don&rsquo;t imagine that the total non-food contribution of plants could be more than <span class="green">12 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h3>The bottom line</h3><p class="first">Let&rsquo;s be realistic. Just like Britain, <em>Europe can&rsquo;t live on its own renewables</em>. So if the aim is to get off fossil fuels, Europe needs nuclear power, or solar power in other people&rsquo;s deserts (as discussed on p179), or both. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><img src="figure243.png" width="221" height="254" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 30.2.</span> A solar water heater providing hot water for a family in Michigan. The system&rsquo;s pump is powered by the small photovoltaic panel on the left.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h2>Redoing the calculations for North America</h2><p class="first">The average American uses 250 kWh per day. Can we hit that target with renewables? What if we imagine imposing shocking efficiency measures (such as efficient cars and high-speed electric trains) such that Americans were reduced to the misery of living on the mere 125 kWh/d of an average European or Japanese citizen? </p><h3>Wind</h3><p class="first">A study by Elliott et al. (1991) assessed the wind energy potential of the USA. The windiest spots are in North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. They reckoned that, over the whole country, 435 000 km<sup>2</sup> of windy land could be exploited without raising too many hackles, and that the electricity generated would be 4600 TWh per year, which is <span class="green">42 kWh per day per person</span> if shared between 300 million people. Their calculations ass- umed an average power density of 1.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>, incidentally &ndash; smaller than the 2 W/m<sup>2</sup> we assumed in Chapter 4. The area of these wind farms, 435 000 km<sup>2</sup>, is roughly the same as the area of California. The amount of wind hardware required (assuming a load factor of 20%) would be a capacity of about 2600 GW, which would be a 200-fold increase in wind hardware in the USA. </p><h3>Offshore wind</h3><p class="first">If we assume that shallow offshore waters with an area equal to the sum of Delaware and Connecticut (20 000 km<sup>2</sup>, a substantial chunk of all shal- low waters on the east coast of the USA) are filled with offshore wind farms having a power density of 3 W/m<sup>2</sup>, we obtain an average power of 60 GW. That&rsquo;s <span class="green">4.8 kWh/d per person</span> if shared between 300 million people. The wind hardware required would be 15 times the total wind hardware currently in the USA. </p><h3>Geothermal</h3><p class="first">I mentioned the MIT geothermal energy study (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2006) in Chapter 16. The authors are upbeat about the pot- ential of geothermal energy in North America, especially in the western states where there is more hotter rock. &ldquo;With a reasonable investment in R&amp;D, enhanced geothermal systems could provide 100 GW(e) or more of cost-competitive generating capacity in the next 50 years. Further, en- hanced geothermal systems provide a secure source of power for the long term.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s assume they are right. 100 GW of electricity is <span class="green">8 kWh/d per person</span> when shared between 300 million. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h3>Hydro</h3><p class="first">The hydroelectric facilities of Canada, the USA, and Mexico generate about 660 TWh per year. Shared between 500 million people, that amounts to 3.6 kWh/d per person. Could the hydroelectric output of North America be doubled? If so, hydro would provide <span class="green">7.2 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h3>What else?</h3><p class="first">The total so far is 42&nbsp;+&nbsp;4.8&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;7.2 = 62 kWh/d per person. Not enough for even a European existence! I could discuss various other options such as the sustainable burning of Canadian forests in power stations. But rather than prolong the agony, let&rsquo;s go immediately for a technology that adds up: concentrating solar power. </p><p>Figure 30.3 shows the area within North America that would provide everyone there (500 million people) with an average power of <span class="green">250 kWh/d</span>. </p><h3>The bottom line</h3><p class="first">North America&rsquo;s <em>non-solar</em> renewables aren&rsquo;t enough for North America to live on. But when we include a massive expansion of solar power, there&rsquo;s enough. So North America needs solar in its own deserts, or nuclear power, or both. </p><h2>Redoing the calculations for the world</h2><p class="first">How can 6 billion people obtain the power for a European standard of living &ndash; 80 kWh per day per person, say? </p><h3>Wind</h3><p class="first">The exceptional spots in the world with strong steady winds are the central states of the USA (Kansas, Oklahoma); Saskatchewan, Canada; the southern extremities of Argentina and Chile; northeast Australia; northeast and northwest China; northwest Sudan; southwest South Africa; Somalia; Iran; and Afghanistan. And everywhere offshore except for a tropical strip 60 degrees wide centred on the equator. </p><p>For our global estimate, let&rsquo;s go with the numbers from Greenpeace and the European Wind Energy Association: &ldquo;the total available wind re- sources worldwide are estimated at 53 000 TWh per year.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s <span class="green">24 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h3>Hydro</h3><p class="first">Worldwide, hydroelectricity currently contributes about 1.4 kWh/d per person. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img style="padding-bottom:2em" src="figure244.png" width="688" height="596" alt=""><p id="tc"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 30.3.</span> The little square strikes again. The 600 km by 600 km square in North America, completely filled with concentrating solar power, would provide enough power to give 500 million people the average American&rsquo;s consumption of 250 kWh/d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This map also shows the square of size 600 km by 600 km in Africa, which we met earlier. I&rsquo;ve assumed a power density of 15 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of one yellow square is a little bigger than the area of Arizona, and 16 times the area of New Jersey. Within each big square is a smaller 145 km by 145 km square showing the area required in the desert &ndash; one New Jersey &ndash; to supply 30 million people with 250 kWh per day per person. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p>From the website <span class="websitetitle">www.ieahydro.org</span>, &ldquo;The International Hydropower Association and the International Energy Agency estimate the world&rsquo;s total technical feasible hydro potential at 14 000 TWh/year [6.4 kWh/d per person on the globe], of which about 8000 TWh/year [<span class="green">3.6 kWh/d per per- son</span>] is currently considered economically feasible for development. Most of the potential for development is in Africa, Asia and Latin America.&rdquo; </p><h3>Tide</h3><p class="first">There are several places in the world with tidal resources on the same scale as the Severn estuary (figure 14.8). In Argentina there are two sites: San Jos&acute;e and Golfo Nuevo; Australia has the Walcott Inlet; the USA &amp; Canada share the Bay of Fundy; Canada has Cobequid; India has the Gulf of Khambat; the USA has Turnagain Arm and Knik Arm; and Russia has Tugur. </p><p>And then there is the world&rsquo;s tidal whopper, a place called Penzhinsk in Russia with a resource of 22 GW &ndash; ten times as big as the Severn! </p><p>Kowalik (2004) estimates that worldwide, 40&ndash;80 GW of tidal power could be generated. Shared between 6 billion people, that comes to <span class="green">0.16&ndash; 0.32 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h3>Wave</h3><p class="first">We can estimate the total extractable power from waves by multiplying the length of exposed coastlines (roughly 300 000 km) by the typical power per unit length of coastline (10 kW per metre): the raw power is thus about 3000 GW. </p><p>Assuming 10% of this raw power is intercepted by systems that are 50%-efficient at converting power to electricity, wave power could deliver <span class="green">0.5 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h3>Geothermal</h3><p class="first">According to D. H. Freeston of the Auckland Geothermal Institute, geo- thermal power amounted on average to about 4 GW, worldwide, in 1995 &ndash; which is 0.01 kWh/d per person. </p><p>If we assume that the MIT authors on p234 were right, and if we assume that the whole world is like America, then geothermal power offers <span class="green">8 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h3>Solar for energy crops</h3><p class="first">People get all excited about energy crops like jatropha, which, it&rsquo;s claimed, wouldn&rsquo;t need to compete with food for land, because it can be grown on wastelands. People need to look at the numbers before they get excited. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">The numbers for jatropha are on p284. Even if <em>all</em> of Africa were completely covered with jatropha plantations, the power produced, shared between six billion people, would be <span class="green">8 kWh/d per person</span> (which is only one third of today&rsquo;s global oil consumption). You can&rsquo;t fix your oil addiction by switching to jatropha! </p><p>Let&rsquo;s estimate a bound on the power that energy crops could deliver for the whole world, using the same method we applied to Britain in Chapter 6: imagine taking all arable land and devoting it to energy crops. 18% of the world&rsquo;s land is currently arable or crop land &ndash; an area of 27 million km2. That&rsquo;s <span class="darkblue">4500 m<sup>2</sup> per person</span>, if shared between 6 billion. Assuming a power density of 0.5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, and losses of 33% in processing and farming, we find that energy crops, fully taking over all agricultural land, would deliver <span class="green">36 kWh/d per person</span>. Now, maybe this is an underestimate since in figure 6.11 (p43) we saw that Brazilian sugarcane can deliver a power density of 1.6 W/m<sup>2</sup>, three times bigger than I just assumed. OK, maybe energy crops from Brazil have some sort of future. But I&rsquo;d like to move on to the last option. </p><h3>Solar heaters, solar photovoltaics, and concentrating solar power</h3><p class="first">Solar thermal water heaters are a no-brainer. They will work almost every- where in the world. China are world leaders in this technology. There&rsquo;s over 100 GW of solar water heating capacity worldwide, and more than half of it is in China. </p><p>Solar photovoltaics were technically feasible for Europe, but I judged them too expensive. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong, obviously. It will be wonderful if the cost of photovoltaic power drops in the same way that the cost of computer power has dropped over the last forty years. </p><p>My guess is that in many regions, the best solar technology for electric- ity production will be the concentrating solar power that we discussed on pages 178 and 236. On those pages we already established that one billion people in Europe and North Africa could be sustained by country-sized solar power facilities in deserts near the Mediterranean; and that half a billion in North America could be sustained by Arizona-sized facilities in the deserts of the USA and Mexico. I&rsquo;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to identify appropriate deserts to help out the other 4.5 billion people in the world. </p><h3>The bottom line</h3><p class="first">The non-solar numbers add up as follows.

First, the energy requirements for carbon capture from thin air are so enormous, it seems almost absurd to talk about it (and there&rsquo;s the worry that raising the possibility of fixing climate change by this sort of geoengineering might promote inaction today). But second, I do think we should talk about it, contemplate how best to do it, and fund research into how to do it better, because capturing carbon from thin air may turn out to be our last line of defense, if climate change is as bad as the climate scientists say, and if humanity fails to take the cheaper and more sensible options that may still be available today. </p><p>Before we discuss capturing carbon from thin air, we need to understand the global carbon picture better. </p><h2>Understanding CO<sub>2</sub></h2><p class="first">When I first planned this book, my intention was to ignore climate change altogether. In some circles, &ldquo;Is climate change happening?&rdquo; was a contro- versial question. As were &ldquo;Is it caused by humans?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; And, dangling at the end of a chain of controversies, &ldquo;What should we do about it?&rdquo; I felt that sustainable energy was a compelling issue by itself, and it was best to avoid controversy. My argument was to be: &ldquo;Never mind when fossil fuels are going to run out; never mind whether climate change is happening; <em>burning fossil fuels is not sustainable anyway</em>; let&rsquo;s imagine liv- ing sustainably, and figure out how much sustainable energy is available.&rdquo; </p><p>However, climate change has risen into public consciousness, and it raises all sorts of interesting back-of-envelope questions. So I decided to discuss it a little in the preface and in this closing chapter. Not a complete discussion, just a few interesting numbers. </p><h3>Units</h3><p class="first">Carbon pollution charges are usually measured in dollars or euros per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> so I&rsquo;ll use the <em>ton</em> of CO<sub>2</sub> as the main unit when talking about per- capita carbon pollution, and the <em>ton of CO<sub>2</sub> per year</em> to measure rates of pollution. (The average European&rsquo;s greenhouse emissions are equivalent to 11 tons per year of CO<sub>2</sub>; or 30 kg per day of CO<sub>2</sub>.) But when talking about carbon in fossil fuels, vegetation, soil, and water, I&rsquo;ll talk about tons of carbon. One ton of CO<sub>2</sub> contains 12/44 tons of carbon, a bit more than a quarter of a ton. On a planetary scale, I&rsquo;ll talk about gigatons of carbon (Gt C). A gigaton of carbon is a billion tons. Gigatons are hard to imagine, but if you want to bring it down to a human scale, imagine burning one </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:4em"><img src="figure434.png" width="221" height="168" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"></div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:40em"><img style="padding-left:5em" src="figure245.png" width="70" height="79" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.1.</span> The weights of an atom of carbon and a molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> are in the ratio 12 to 44, because the carbon atom weighs 12 units and the two oxygen atoms weigh 16 each. 12 + 16 +16 = 44.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">animal life, and decaying materials). Soils and vegetation together contain about 3700 Gt. Accessible fossil fuels &ndash; mainly coal &ndash; contain about 1600 Gt. Finally, the atmosphere contains about 600 Gt of carbon. </p><p>Until recently, all these pools of carbon were roughly in balance: all flows of carbon out of a pool (say, soils, vegetation, or atmosphere) were balanced by equal flows into that pool. The flows into and out of the fossil fuel pool were both negligible. Then humans started burning fossil fuels. This added two extra <em>unbalanced</em> flows, as shown in figure 31.3. </p><p>The rate of fossil fuel burning was roughly 1 Gt C/y in 1920, 2 Gt C/y in 1955, and 8.4 Gt C in 2006. (These figures include a small contribution from cement production, which releases CO<sub>2</sub> from limestone.) </p><p>How has this significant extra flow of carbon modified the picture shown in figure 31.2? Well, it&rsquo;s not exactly known. Figure 31.3 shows the key things that <em>are</em> known. Much of the extra 8.4 Gt C per year that we&rsquo;re putting into the atmosphere stays in the atmosphere, raising the at- mospheric concentration of carbon-dioxide. The atmosphere equilibrates fairly rapidly with the surface waters of the oceans (this equilibration takes only five or ten years), and there is a net flow of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the oceans, amounting to 2 Gt C per year. (Recent research indicates this rate of carbon-uptake by the oceans may be reducing, however.) This unbalanced flow into the surface waters causes ocean acidification, which is bad news for coral. Some extra carbon is moving into vegetation and soil too, perhaps about 1.5 Gt C per year, but these flows are less well measured. Because roughly half of the carbon emissions are staying in the atmosphere, continued carbon pollution at a rate of 8.4 Gt C per year will continue to increase CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere, and in the surface waters. </p><p>What is the long-term destination of the extra CO<sub>2</sub>? Well, since the amount in fossil fuels is so much smaller than the total in the oceans, &ldquo;in the long term&rdquo; the extra carbon will make its way into the ocean, and the amounts of carbon in the atmosphere, vegetation, and soil will return to normal. However, &ldquo;the long term&rdquo; means thousands of years. Equilibration between atmosphere and the <em>surface</em> waters is rapid, as I said, but figures 31.2 and 31.3 show a dashed line separating the surface waters of the ocean from the rest of the ocean. On a time-scale of 50 years, this boundary is virtually a solid wall. Radioactive carbon dispersed across the globe by the atomic bomb tests of the 1960s and 70s has penetrated the oceans to a depth of only about 400 m. In contrast the average depth of the oceans is about 4000 m. </p><p>The oceans circulate slowly: a chunk of deep-ocean water takes about 1000 years to roll up to the surface and down again. The circulation of the deep waters is driven by a combination of temperature gradients and salinity gradients, so it&rsquo;s called the thermohaline circulation (in contrast to the circulations of the surface waters, which are wind-driven). </p><p>This slow turn-over of the oceans has a crucial consequence: we have </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure247.png" width="190" height="482" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.3.</span> The arrows show two extra carbon flows produced by burning fossil fuels. There is an imbalance between the 8.4 Gt C/y emissions into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and the 2 Gt C/y take-up of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans. This cartoon omits the less-well quantified flows between atmosphere, soil, vegetation, and so forth.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">enough fossil fuels to seriously influence the climate over the next 1000 years. </p><h2>Where is the carbon going</h2><p class="first">Figure 31.3 is a gross simplification. For example, humans are causing ad- ditional flows not shown on this diagram: the burning of peat and forests in Borneo in 1997 alone released about 0.7 Gt C. Accidentally-started fires in coal seams release about 0.25 Gt C per year. </p><p>Nevertheless, this cartoon helps us understand roughly what will hap- pen in the short term and the medium term under various policies. First, if carbon pollution follows a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; trajectory, burning another 500 Gt of carbon over the next 50 years, we can expect the carbon to con- tinue to trickle gradually into the surface waters of the ocean at a rate of 2 Gt C per year. By 2055, at least 100 Gt of the 500 would have gone into the surface waters, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the atmosphere would be roughly double their pre-industrial levels. </p><p>If fossil-fuel burning were reduced to zero in the 2050s, the 2 Gt flow from atmosphere to ocean would also reduce significantly. (I used to imag- ine that this flow into the ocean would persist for decades, but that would be true only if the surface waters were out of equilibrium with the atmo- sphere; but, as I mentioned earlier, the surface waters and the atmosphere reach equilibrium within just a few years.) Much of the 500 Gt we put into the atmosphere would only gradually drift into the oceans over the next few thousand years, as the surface waters roll down and are replaced by new water from the deep. </p><p>Thus our perturbation of the carbon concentration might eventually be righted, but only after thousands of years. And that&rsquo;s assuming that this large perturbation of the atmosphere doesn&rsquo;t drastically alter the ecosystem. It&rsquo;s conceivable, for example, that the acidification of the surface waters of the ocean might cause a sufficient extinction of ocean plant-life that a new vicious cycle kicks in: acidification means extinguished plant-life, means plant-life absorbs less CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean, means oceans become even more acidic. Such vicious cycles (which scientists call &ldquo;positive feedbacks&rdquo; or &ldquo;runaway feedbacks&rdquo;) have happened on earth before: it&rsquo;s believed, for example, that ice ages ended relatively rapidly because of positive feedback cycles in which rising temperatures caused surface snow and ice to melt, which reduced the ground&rsquo;s reflection of sunlight, which meant the ground absorbed more heat, which led to increased temperatures. (Melted snow &ndash; water &ndash; is much darker than frozen snow.) Another positive feedback possibility to worry about involves methane hydrates, which are frozen in gigaton quantities in places like Arctic Siberia, and in 100-gigaton quantities on continental shelves. Global warming greater than 1 &deg;C would possibly melt methane hydrates, which release methane into the atmosphere, and methane increases global warming more strongly </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure248.png" width="221" height="314" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure 31.4.</span> Decay of a small pulse of CO<sub>2</sub> added to today&rsquo;s atmosphere, according to the Bern model of the carbon cycle.

I highly recommend the books <em>Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change</em> (Schellnhuber et al., 2006) and <em>Global Climate Change</em> (Dessler and Parson, 2006). Also the papers by Hansen et al. (2007) and Charney et al. (1979). </p><p>The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the idea of fixing climate change by sucking carbon dioxide from thin air; we discuss the energy cost of this sucking next. </p><h2>The cost of sucking</h2><p class="first">Today, pumping carbon out of the ground is big bucks. In the future, per- haps pumping carbon <em>into</em> the ground is going to be big bucks. Assuming that inadequate action is taken now to halt global carbon pollution, perhaps a coalition of the willing will in a few decades pay to create a giant vacuum cleaner, and clean up everyone&rsquo;s mess. </p><p>Before we go into details of how to capture carbon from thin air, let&rsquo;s discuss the unavoidable energy cost of carbon capture. Whatever technolo- gies we use, they have to respect the laws of physics, and unfortunately grabbing CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and concentrating it requires energy. The laws of physics say that the energy required must be at least 0.2 kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub> (table 31.5). Given that real processes are typically 35% efficient at best, I&rsquo;d be amazed if the energy cost of carbon capture is ever reduced below 0.55 kWh per kg. </p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s assume that we wish to neutralize a typical European&rsquo;s CO<sub>2</sub> output of 11 tons per year, which is 30 kg per day per person. The energy required, assuming a cost of 0.55 kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub>, is <span class="red">16.5 kWh per day per person</span>. This is exactly the same as <span class="red">British electricity consumption</span>. So powering the giant vacuum cleaner may require us to <em>double</em> our electricity production &ndash; or at least, to somehow obtain extra power equal to our current electricity production. </p><p>If the cost of running giant vacuum cleaners can be brought down, brilliant, let&rsquo;s make them. But no amount of research and development can get round the laws of physics, which say that grabbing CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and concentrating it into liquid CO<sub>2</sub> requires at least 0.2 kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub>. </p><p>Now, what&rsquo;s the best way to suck CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air? I&rsquo;ll discuss four technologies for building the giant vacuum cleaner: </p><p class="first p244list"><span class="p244mark">A.</span> chemical pumps; </p><p class="first p244list"><span class="p244mark">B.</span> trees; </p><p class="first p244list"><span class="p244mark">C.</span> accelerated weathering of rocks; </p><p class="first p244list"><span class="p244mark">D.</span> ocean nourishment. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">wood and burying it in a hole in the ground, while, next door, humanity continues digging up fossil wood and setting fire to it? It&rsquo;s daft to imagine creating buried wood at the same time as digging up buried wood. Even so, let&rsquo;s work out the land area required to solve the climate problem with trees. </p><p>The best plants in Europe capture carbon at a rate of roughly 10 tons of dry wood per hectare per year &ndash; equivalent to about 15 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per hectare per year &ndash; so to fix a European&rsquo;s output of 11 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year we need <span class="darkblue">7500 square metres</span> of forest per person. This required area of 7500 square metres per person is <em>twice the area of Britain</em> per person. And then you&rsquo;d have to find somewhere to permanently store 7.5 tons of wood per person per year! At a density of 500 kg per m<sup>3</sup>, each person&rsquo;s wood would occupy 15 m<sup>3</sup> per year. A lifetime&rsquo;s wood &ndash; which, remember, must be safely stored away and never burned &ndash; would occupy 1000 m<sup>3</sup>. That&rsquo;s five times the entire volume of a typical house. If anyone proposes using trees to undo climate change, they need to realise that country-sized facilities are required. I don&rsquo;t see how it could ever work. </p><h2>C. Enhanced weathering of rocks</h2><p class="first">Is there a sneaky way to avoid the significant energy cost of the chemical approach to carbon-sucking? Here is an interesting idea: pulverize rocks that are capable of absorbing CO<sub>2</sub>, and leave them in the open air. This idea can be pitched as the acceleration of a natural geological process. Let me explain. </p><p>Two flows of carbon that I omitted from figure 31.3 are the flow of carbon from rocks into oceans, associated with the natural weathering of rocks, and the natural precipitation of carbon into marine sediments, which eventually turn back into rocks. These flows are relatively small, in- volving about 0.2 Gt C per year (0.7 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> per year). So they are dwarfed by current human carbon emissions, which are about 40 times bigger. But the suggestion of enhanced-weathering advocates is that we could fix climate change by speeding up the rate at which rocks are broken down and absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. The appropriate rocks to break down include olivines or mag- nesium silicate minerals, which are widespread. The idea would be to find mines in places surrounded by many square kilometres of land on which crushed rocks could be spread, or perhaps to spread the crushed rocks directly on the oceans. Either way, the rocks would absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and turn into carbonates and the resulting carbonates would end up being washed into the oceans. To pulverize the rocks into appropriately small grains for the reaction with CO<sub>2</sub> to take place requires only <span class="red">0.04 kWh per kg of sucked CO<sub>2</sub></span>. Hang on, isn&rsquo;t that smaller than the 0.20 kWh per kg required by the laws of physics? Yes, but nothing is wrong: the rocks themselves are the sources of the missing energy. Silicates have higher energy than carbonates, so the rocks pay the energy cost of sucking the CO<sub>2</sub> from thin </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:7em"><div class="sidebarcaption">1 hectare = 10 000 m<sup>2</sup></div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">in figure 31.6 shows these areas to scale alongside the British Isles. As usual, a plan that actually adds up requires country-sized facilities! And we haven&rsquo;t touched on how we would make all the required urea. </p><p>While it&rsquo;s an untested idea, and currently illegal, I do find ocean nour- ishment interesting because, in contrast to geological carbon storage, it&rsquo;s a technology that might be implemented even if the international com- munity doesn&rsquo;t agree on a high value for cleaning up carbon pollution; fishermen might nourish the oceans purely in order to catch more fish. </p><blockquote><p>Commentators can be predicted to oppose manipulations of the ocean, focusing on the uncertainties rather than on the potential benefits. They will be playing to the public&rsquo;s fear of the unknown. People are ready to passively accept an escalation of an established practice (e.g., dumping CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere) while being wary of innovations that might improve their future well being.

How does it depend on properties of the car? Could we make cars that are 100 times more efficient? Let&rsquo;s make a simple cartoon of car-driving, to describe where the energy goes.

Table A.8 gives some typical values. </p><p>The coefficient of rolling resistance for a car is about 0.01. The effect of rolling resistance is just like perpetually driving up a hill with a slope of one in a hundred. So rolling friction is about 100 newtons per ton, independent of speed. You can confirm this by pushing a typical one-ton car along a flat road. Once you&rsquo;ve got it moving, you&rsquo;ll find you can keep it moving with one hand. (100 newtons is the weight of 100 apples.)

They have a point: most cars&rsquo; engines have an optimum revolution rate, and the choice of gears of the car determines a range of speeds at which the optimum engine efficiency can be delivered. If my suggested ex- periment of halving the car&rsquo;s speed takes the car out of this designed range of speeds, the consumption might not fall by as much as four-fold. My tacit assumption that the engine&rsquo;s efficiency is the same at all speeds and all loads led to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s always good (in terms of miles per gallon) to travel slower; but if the engine&rsquo;s efficiency drops off at low speeds, then the most fuel-efficient speed might be at an intermediate speed that makes a compromise between going slow and keeping the engine efficient. For the BMW 318ti in figure A.12, for example, the optimum speed is about 60 km/h. But if society were to decide that car speeds should be reduced, there is nothing to stop engines and gears being redesigned so that the peak engine efficiency was found at the right speed.

The line shows the relationship &ldquo;power proportional to <em>v</em><sup>3</sup>.&rdquo; </p><h3>Electric cars: is range a problem? </h3><p class="first">People often say that the range of electric cars is not big enough. Electric car advocates say &ldquo;no problem, we can just put in more batteries&rdquo; &ndash; and that&rsquo;s true, but we need to work out what effect the extra batteries have on the energy consumption. The answer depends sensitively on what energy density we assume the batteries deliver: for an energy density of 40 Wh/kg (typical of lead-acid batteries), we&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s hard to push the range beyond 200 or 300 km; but for an energy density of 120 Wh/kg (typical of various lithium-based batteries), a range of 500 km is easily achievable. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s assume that the mass of the car and occupants is 740 kg, <em>without</em> any batteries. In due course we&rsquo;ll add 100 kg, 200 kg, 500 kg, or perhaps 1000 kg of batteries. Let&rsquo;s assume a typical speed of 50 km/h (30 mph); a drag-area of 0.8 m<sup>2</sup>; a rolling resistance of 0.01; a distance between stops of 500 m; an engine efficiency of 85%; and that during stops and starts, regenerative braking recovers half of the kinetic energy of the car. Charging up the car from the mains is assumed to be 85% efficient. Figure A.14 shows the transport cost of the car versus its range, as we vary the amount of battery on board. The upper curve shows the result for a battery whose energy density is 40 Wh/kg (old-style lead-acid batteries). The range is limited by a wall at about 500 km. To get close to this maximum range, we have to take along comically large batteries: for a range of 400 km, for example, 2000 kg of batteries are required, and the transport cost is above 25 kWh per 100 km. If we are content with a range of 180 km, however, we can get by with 500 kg of batteries. Things get much better when we switch to lighter lithium-ion batteries. At an energy density of 120 Wh/kg, electric cars with 500 kg of batteries can easily deliver a range of 500 km. The transport cost is predicted to be about 13 kWh per 100 km. </p><p>It thus seems to me that the range problem has been solved by the advent of modern batteries. It would be nice to have even better batteries, but an energy density of 120 Wh per kg is already good enough, as long as we&rsquo;re happy for the batteries in a car to weigh up to 500 kg. In practice I imagine most people would be content to have a range of 300 km, which can be delivered by 250 kg of batteries. If these batteries were divided into ten 25 kg chunks, separately unpluggable, then a car user could keep just four of the ten chunks on board when he&rsquo;s doing regular commuting (100 kg gives a range of 140 km); and collect an extra six chunks from a battery-recharging station when he wants to make longer-range trips. During long-range trips, he would exchange his batteries for a fresh set at a battery-exchange station every 300 km or so. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><img src="figure258.png" width="222" height="357" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure A.14.</span> Theory of electric car range (horizontal axis) and transport cost (vertical axis) as a function of battery mass, for two battery technologies.

With the same weight of modern batteries, delivering 120 Wh per kg, an electric car can have a range of more than 500 km. Both cars would have an energy cost of about 13 kWh per 100 km.

The maximum fraction of the incoming energy that can be extracted by a disc-like windmill was worked out by a German physicist called Albert Betz in 1919.

The &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; or &ldquo;peak power&rdquo; is the <em>maximum</em> power the windmill can generate in optimal conditions. Usually, wind turbines are designed to start running at wind speeds somewhere around 3 to 5 m/s and to stop if the wind speed reaches gale speeds of 25 m/s. The actual average power delivered is the &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; multiplied by a factor that describes the fraction of the time that wind conditions are near optimal. This factor, sometimes called the &ldquo;load factor&rdquo; or &ldquo;capacity factor,&rdquo; depends on the site; a typical load factor for a good site in the UK is 30%. In the Netherlands, the typical load factor is 22%; in Germany, it is 19%. </p><h3>Other people&rsquo;s estimates of wind farm power per unit area </h3><p class="first">In the government&rsquo;s study [<span class="websitetitle">www.world-nuclear.org/policy/DTI-PIU.pdf</span>] the UK onshore wind resource is estimated using an assumed wind farm power per unit area of at most 9 W/m<sup>2</sup> (capacity, not average production). If the capacity factor is 33% then the average power production would be 3 W/m<sup>2</sup>. </p><p>The London Array is an offshore wind farm planned for the outer Thames Estuary. With its 1 GW capacity, it is expected to become the world&rsquo;s largest offshore wind farm. The completed wind farm will consist of 271 wind turbines in 245 km<sup>2</sup> [<span class="tinylink">6o86ec</span>] and will deliver an average power of 3100 GWh per year (350 MW). (Cost &pound;1.5 bn.) That&rsquo;s a power per unit area of 350 MW/245 km<sup>2</sup> = 1.4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. This is lower than other offshore farms because, I guess, the site includes a big channel (Knock Deep) that&rsquo;s too deep (about 20 m) for economical planting of turbines. </p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m more worried about what these plans [for the proposed London Array wind farm] will do to this landscape and our way of life than I ever was about a Nazi invasion on the beach.</p><cite>Bill Boggia of Graveney, where the undersea cables of the wind farm will come ashore. </cite></blockquote><div class="imgcap" style="top:12em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure B.8.</span> The qr5 from <span class="websitetitle">quietrevolution.co.uk</span>.

Additionally, unlike cars and trains, planes have to expend energy <em>in order to stay up</em>. </p><p>Planes stay up by throwing air down. When the plane pushes down on air, the air pushes up on the plane (because Newton&rsquo;s third law tells it to). As long as this upward push, which is called lift, is big enough to balance the downward weight of the plane, the plane avoids plummeting downwards. </p><p>When the plane throws air down, it gives that air kinetic energy. So creating lift requires energy. The total power required by the plane is the sum of the power required to create lift and the power required to overcome ordinary drag. (The power required to create lift is usually called &ldquo;induced drag,&rdquo; by the way. But I&rsquo;ll call it the lift power, <em>P</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>lift</sub></span>.) </p><p>The two equations we&rsquo;ll need, in order to work out a theory of flight, are Newton&rsquo;s second law: </p> <p style="margin-left:5em">force = rate of change of momentum</p><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-1.5em">(C.1)</div><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure270.png" width="219" height="539" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.1.</span> Birds: two Arctic terns, a bar-tailed godwit, and a Boeing 747.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img src="figure271.png" width="462" height="165" alt=""> <img style="margin:1em 0 3em 6em" src="figure272.png" width="296" height="155" alt=""><p class="first">and Newton&rsquo;s third law, which I just mentioned: </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 3em">force exerted on A by B = &minus; force exerted on B by A</p><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-2.25em">(C.2)</div><p class="first">If you don&rsquo;t like equations, I can tell you the punchline now: we&rsquo;re going to find that the power required to create lift turns out to be <em>equal</em> to the power required to overcome drag.

We can work out two sorts of transport efficiency: the energy cost of moving <em>weight</em> around, measured in kWh per ton-kilometre; and the energy cost of moving people, measured in kWh per 100 passenger-kilometres. </p><h3>Efficiency in weight terms </h3><p class="first">Thrust is a force, and a force is an energy per unit distance. The total energy used per unit distance is bigger by a factor (1/<em>&epsilon;</em>), where <em>&epsilon;</em> is the efficiency of the engine, which we&rsquo;ll take to be 1/3. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s the gross transport cost, defined to be the energy per unit weight (of the entire craft) per unit distance: </p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 8em" src="E162-0-0.png" width="229" height="115" alt=""></div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-9em">(C.24)</div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-6.5em">(C.25)</div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-3.5em">(C.26)</div><p class="first">So the transport cost is just a dimensionless quantity (related to a plane&rsquo;s shape and its engine&rsquo;s efficiency), multiplied by <em>g</em>, the acceleration due to gravity. Notice that this gross transport cost applies to all planes, but depends only on three simple properties of the plane: its drag coefficient, the shape of the plane, and its engine efficiency. It doesn&rsquo;t depend on the size of the plane, nor on its weight, nor on the density of air. If we plug in <em>&epsilon;</em> = 1/3 and assume a lift-to-drag ratio of 20 we find the gross transport cost of <em>any</em> plane, according to our cartoon, is </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 12em">0.15 <em>g</em> </p><p class="first">or</p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 10em">0.4 kWh/ton-km. </p><h3>Can planes be improved?</h3><p class="first">If engine efficiency can be boosted only a tiny bit by technological progress, and if the shape of the plane has already been essentially perfected, then there is little that can be done about the dimensionless quantity. The trans- port efficiency is close to its physical limit. The aerodynamics community say that the shape of planes could be improved a little by a switch to blended-wing bodies, and that the drag coefficient could be reduced a </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:5em"><img src="figure277.png" width="221" height="145" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.9.</span> Cessna 310N: <span class="mauve">60 kWh per 100 passenger-km</span>.

Adding laminar flow control to existing planes would deliver a 15% improvement in drag coefficient, and the change of shape to blended-wing bodies is predicted to improve the drag coefficient by about 18% (Green, 2006). And equation (C.26) says that the transport cost is proportional to the square root of the drag coefficient, so improve- ments of <em>c</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>d</sub></span> by 15% or 18% would improve transport cost by 7.5% and 9% respectively. </p><p>This gross transport cost is the energy cost of moving weight around, <em>including the weight of the plane itself</em>. To estimate the energy required to move freight by plane, per unit weight of freight, we need to divide by the fraction that is cargo. For example, if a full 747 freighter is about 1/3 cargo, then its transport cost is </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 12em">0.45 <em>g</em>,</p><p class="first">or roughly 1.2 kWh/ton-km. This is just a little bigger than the transport cost of a truck, which is 1 kWh/ton-km. </p><h3>Transport efficiency in terms of bodies</h3><p class="first">Similarly, we can estimate a passenger transport-efficiency for a 747.</p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 4em" src="E168-0-0.png" width="331" height="157" alt=""></div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-10.2em">(C.27)</div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-7.2em">(C.28)</div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-4.7em">(C.29)</div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-2.7em">(C.30)</div><p class="first">This is a bit more efficient than a typical single-occupant car (12 km per litre). So travelling by plane is more energy-efficient than car if there are only one or two people in the car; and cars are more efficient if there are three or more passengers in the vehicle. </p><h3>Key points</h3><p class="first">We&rsquo;ve covered quite a lot of ground! Let&rsquo;s recap the key ideas. Half of the work done by a plane goes into <em>staying up</em>; the other half goes into <em>keeping going</em>. The fuel efficiency at the optimal speed, expressed as an energy-per- distance-travelled, was found in the force (C.22), and it was simply proportional to the weight of the plane; the constant of proportionality is the drag-to-lift ratio, which is determined by the shape of the plane. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure278.png" width="219" height="134" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.10.</span> &ldquo;Fasten your cufflinks.&rdquo; A Bombardier Learjet 60XR carrying 8 passengers at 780 km/h has a transport cost of <span class="mauve">150 kWh per 100 passenger-km</span>. Photograph by Adrian Pingstone.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">So whereas lowering speed-limits for cars would reduce the energy con- sumed per distance travelled, there is no point in considering speed-limits for planes. Planes that are up in the air have optimal speeds, different for each plane, depending on its weight, and they already go at their optimal speeds. If you ordered a plane to go slower, its energy consumption would <em>increase</em>. The only way to make a plane consume fuel more efficiently is to put it on the ground and stop it. Planes have been fantastically optimized, and there is no prospect of significant improvements in plane efficiency. (See pages 37 and 132 for further discussion of the notion that new super- jumbos are &ldquo;far more efficient&rdquo; than old jumbos; and p35 for discussion of the notion that turboprops are &ldquo;far more efficient&rdquo; than jets.) </p><h3>Range</h3><p class="first">Another prediction we can make is, what&rsquo;s the range of a plane or bird &ndash; the biggest distance it can go without refuelling? You might think that bigger planes have a bigger range, but the prediction of our model is startlingly simple. The range of the plane, the maximum distance it can go before refuelling, is proportional to its velocity and to the total energy of the fuel, and inversely proportional to the rate at which it guzzles fuel: </p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 7em" src="E169-0-0.png" width="228" height="41" alt=""></div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-3.6em">(C.31)</div><p class="first">Now, the total energy of fuel is the calorific value of the fuel, <em>C</em> (in joules per kilogram), times its mass; and the mass of fuel is some fraction <em>f</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>fuel</sub></span> of the total mass of the plane.

The longest recorded non-stop flight by a bird was a distance of 11 000 km, by a bar- tailed godwit. </p><p>How far did Steve Fossett go in the specially-designed Scaled Composites Model 311 Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer? 41 467 km. [<span class="tinylink">33ptcg</span>] An unusual plane: 83% of its take-off weight was fuel; the flight made careful use of the jet-stream to boost its distance. Fragile, the plane had several failures along the way. </p><p>One interesting point brought out by this cartoon: if we ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the optimum air-density to fly in?&rdquo;, we find that the <em>thrust</em> required (C.20) at the optimum speed is independent of the density. So our cartoon plane would be equally happy to fly at any height; there isn&rsquo;t an optimum density; the plane could achieve the same miles-per-gallon in any density; but the optimum <em>speed</em> does depend on the density (<em>v</em><sup>2</sup> ~ 1/<em>&rho;</em>, equation (C.16)). So all else being equal, our cartoon plane would have the shortest journey time if it flew in the lowest-density air possible. Now real engines&rsquo; efficien- cies aren&rsquo;t independent of speed and air density. As a plane gets lighter by burning fuel, our cartoon says its optimal speed at a given density would reduce (<em>v</em><sup>2</sup> ~ <em>mg</em>/(<em>&rho;</em>(<em>c</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>d</sub></span><em>A</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>p</sub></span><em>A</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>s</sub></span>)<sup>1/2</sup>)). So a plane travelling in air of constant density should slow down a little as it gets lighter. But a plane can both keep going at a <em>constant speed</em> and continue flying at its <em>optimal</em> speed if it increases its altitude so as to reduce the air density. Next time you&rsquo;re on a long-distance flight, you could check whether the pilot increases the cruising height from, say, 31 000 feet to 39 000 feet by the end of the flight. </p><h3>How would a hydrogen plane perform?</h3><p class="first">We&rsquo;ve already argued that the efficiency of flight, in terms of energy per ton-km, is just a simple dimensionless number times <em>g</em>. Changing the fuel isn&rsquo;t going to change this fundamental argument. Hydrogen-powered planes are worth discussing if we&rsquo;re hoping to reduce climate-changing emissions. They might also have better range. But don&rsquo;t expect them to be radically more energy-efficient. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><div class="sidebarcaption">You can think of <em>d</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>Fuel</sub></span> as the distance that the fuel could throw itself if it suddenly converted all its chemical energy to kinetic energy and launched itself on a parabolic trajectory with no air resistance. [To be precise, the distance achieved by the optimal parabola is twice <em>C</em>/<em>g</em>.] This distance is also the <em>vertical</em> height to which the fuel could throw itself if there were no air resistance. Another amusing thing to notice is that the calorific value of a fuel <em>C</em>, which I gave in joules per kilogram, is also a squared-velocity (just as the energy-to-mass ratio <em>E</em>/<em>m</em> in Einstein&rsquo;s <em>E</em> = <em>mc</em><sup>2</sup> is a squared-velocity, <em>c</em><sup>2</sup>): 40&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup> J&nbsp;per&nbsp;kg is (6000 m/s)<sup>2</sup>. So one way to think about fat is &ldquo;fat is 6000 metres per second.&rdquo; If you want to lose weight by going jogging, 6000 m/s (12 000 mph) is the speed you should aim for in order to lose it all in one giant leap.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h3>Possible areas for improvement of plane efficiency</h3><p class="first">Formation flying in the style of geese could give a 10% improvement in fuel efficiency (because the lift-to-drag ratio of the formation is higher than that of a single aircraft), but this trick relies, of course, on the geese wanting to migrate to the same destination at the same time. </p><p>Optimizing the hop lengths: long-range planes (designed for a range of say 15 000 km) are not quite as fuel-efficient as shorter-range planes, because they have to carry extra fuel, which makes less space for cargo and passengers. It would be more energy-efficient to fly shorter hops in shorter-range planes. The sweet spot is when the hops are about 5000 km long, so typical long-distance journeys would have one or two refuelling stops (Green, 2006). Multi-stage long-distance flying might be about 15% more fuel-efficient; but of course it would introduce other costs. </p><h3>Eco-friendly aeroplanes</h3><p class="first">Occasionally you may hear about people making eco-friendly aeroplanes. Earlier in this chapter, however, our cartoon made the assertion that the transport cost of <em>any</em> plane is about </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 11em">0.4 kWh/ton-km.</p><p class="first">According to the cartoon, the only ways in which a plane could signifi- cantly improve on this figure are to reduce air resistance (perhaps by some new-fangled vacuum-cleaners-in-the-wings trick) or to change the geometry of the plane (making it look more like a glider, with immensely wide wings compared to the fuselage, or getting rid of the fuselage altogether). </p><p>So, let&rsquo;s look at the latest news story about &ldquo;eco-friendly aviation&rdquo; and see whether one of these planes can beat the 0.4 kWh per ton-km bench- mark. If a plane uses less than 0.4 kWh per ton-km, we might conclude that the cartoon is defective. </p><p>The Electra, a wood-and-fabric single-seater, flew for 48 minutes for 50 km around the southern Alps [<span class="tinylink">6r32hf</span>]. The Electra has a 9-m wingspan and an 18-kW electric motor powered by 48 kg of lithium-polymer batteries. The aircraft&rsquo;s take-off weight is 265 kg (134 kg of aircraft, 47 kg of batteries, and 84 kg of human cargo). On 23rd December, 2007 it flew a distance of 50 km. If we assume that the battery&rsquo;s energy density was 130 Wh/kg, and that the flight used 90% of a full charge (5.5 kWh), the transport cost was roughly </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 11em">0.4 kWh/ton-km,</p><p class="first">which exactly matches our cartoon.

But in this book the bottom line is always: &ldquo;where is the energy to come from?&rdquo; </p><h3>Many boats are birds too</h3><p class="first">Some time after writing this cartoon of flight, I realized that it applies to more than just the birds of the air &ndash; it applies to hydrofoils, and to other high-speed watercraft too &ndash; all those that ride higher in the water when moving. </p><p>Figure C.13 shows the principle of the hydrofoil. The weight of the craft is supported by a tilted underwater wing, which may be quite tiny compared with the craft. The wing generates lift by throwing fluid down, just like the plane of figure C.2. If we assume that the drag is dominated by the drag on the wing, and that the wing dimensions and vessel speed have been optimized to minimize the energy expended per unit distance, then the best possible transport cost, in the sense of energy per ton-kilometre, will be just the same as in equation (C.26): </p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 12em" src="E181-0-0.png" width="80" height="43" alt=""></div><div class="eqref" style="margin-top:-3.6em">(C.34)</div><p class="first">where <em>c</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>d</sub></span> is the drag coefficient of the underwater wing, <em>f</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>A</sub></span> is the dimen- sionless area ratio defined before, <em>&epsilon;</em> is the engine efficiency, and <em>g</em> is the acceleration due to gravity. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure500-2-0-0-0.png" width="220" height="120" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.13.</span> Hydrofoil.

But the remarkable thing about this theory is that it has no dependence on the density of the fluid through which the wing is flying. So our ballpark prediction is that the transport cost (energy-per-distance- per-weight, including the vehicle weight) of a hydrofoil is <em>the same</em> as the transport cost of an aeroplane! Namely, roughly 0.4 kWh per ton-km. </p><p>For vessels that skim the water surface, such as high-speed catamarans and water-skiers, an accurate cartoon should also include the energy going into making waves, but I&rsquo;m tempted to guess that this hydrofoil theory is still roughly right. </p><p>I&rsquo;ve not yet found data on the transport-cost of a hydrofoil, but some data for a passenger-carrying catamaran travelling at 41 km/h seem to agree pretty well: it consumes roughly 1 kWh per ton-km. </p><p>It&rsquo;s quite a surprise to me to learn that an island hopper who goes from island to island by plane not only gets there faster than someone who hops by boat &ndash; he quite probably uses less energy too. </p><h2>Other ways of staying up</h2><h3>Airships</h3><p class="first">This chapter has emphasized that planes can&rsquo;t be made more energy- efficient by slowing them down, because any benefit from reduced air- resistance is more than cancelled by having to chuck air down harder. Can this problem be solved by switching strategy: not throwing air down, but being as light as air instead? An airship, blimp, zeppelin, or dirigible uses an enormous helium-filled balloon, which is lighter than air, to counteract the weight of its little cabin. The disadvantage of this strategy is that the enormous balloon greatly increases the air resistance of the vehicle. </p><p>The way to keep the energy cost of an airship (per weight, per distance) low is to move slowly, to be fish-shaped, and to be very large and long. Let&rsquo;s work out a cartoon of the energy required by an idealized airship. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll assume the balloon is ellipsoidal, with cross-sectional area <em>A</em> and length <em>L</em>. The volume is <em>V</em> = <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> AL.

You can demonstrate the ground effect by flicking a piece of card across a flat table. Maintaining this air-cushion requires very little energy, so the ground-effect aircraft, in energy terms, is a lot like a surface vehicle with no rolling resistance. Its main energy expenditure is associated with air resistance. Remember that for a plane at its optimal speed, half of its energy expenditure is associated with air resistance, and half with throwing air down. </p><p>The Soviet Union developed the ekranoplan as a military transport ve- hicle and missile launcher in the Khrushchev era. The Lun ekranoplan could travel at 500 km/h, and the total thrust of its eight engines was 1000 kN, though this total was not required once the vessel had risen clear of the water. Assuming the cruising thrust was one quarter of the maximum; that the engines were 30% efficient; and that of its 400-ton weight, 100 tons were cargo, this vehicle had a net freight-transport cost of <span class="mauve">2 kWh per ton-km</span>. I imagine that, if perfected for non-military freight transport, the ekranoplan might have a freight-transport cost about half that of an ordinary aeroplane. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:30em"><img src="figure282.png" width="221" height="257" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure C.16.</span> The Lun ekranoplan &ndash; slightly longer and heavier than a Boeing 747.

In practice, many of these methods require so much energy to be put <em>in</em> along the way that they are scarcely net contributors (figure 6.14). But in what follows, I&rsquo;ll ignore such embodied-energy costs. </p><h2>Energy crops as a coal substitute</h2><p class="first">If we grow in Britain energy crops such as willow, miscanthus, or poplar (which have an average power of 0.5 W per square metre of land), then shove them in a 40%-efficient power station, the resulting power per unit area is <span class="green">0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. If one eighth of Britain (500 m<sup>2</sup> per person) were covered in these plantations, the resulting power would be <span class="green">2.5 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h2>Petroleum substitution</h2><p class="first">There are several ways to turn plants into liquid fuels. I&rsquo;ll express the po- tential of each method in terms of its power per unit area (as in figure 6.11). </p><h3>Britain&rsquo;s main biodiesel crop, rape</h3><p class="first">Typically, rape is sown in September and harvested the following August. Currently 450 000 hectares of oilseed rape are grown in the UK each year. (That&rsquo;s 2% of the UK.) Fields of rape produce 1200 litres of biodiesel per hectare per year; biodiesel has an energy of 9.8 kWh per litre; So that&rsquo;s a power per unit area of <span class="green">0.13 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. </p><p>If we used 25% of Britain for oilseed rape, we&rsquo;d obtain biodiesel with an energy content of <span class="green">3.1 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h3>Sugar beet to ethanol</h3><p class="first">Sugar beet, in the UK, delivers an impressive yield of 53 t per hectare per year. And 1 t of sugar beet makes 108 litres of bioethanol. Bioethanol has an energy density of 6 kWh per litre, so this process has a power per unit area of <span class="green">0.4 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>, not accounting for energy inputs required. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure283.png" width="221" height="180" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure D.1.</span> Two trees.</div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:35em"><img src="figure284.png" width="219" height="207" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure D.2.</span> Oilseed rape.

Bioethanol has an energy density of 6 kWh per litre, so this process has a power per unit area of <span class="green">1.2 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. </p><h3>Bioethanol from corn in the USA</h3><p class="first">The power per unit area of bioethanol from corn is astonishingly low. Just for fun, let&rsquo;s report the numbers first in archaic units. 1 acre produces 122 bushels of corn per year, which makes 122 &times; 2.6 US gallons of ethanol, which at 84 000 BTU per gallon means a power per unit area of just <span class="green">0.02 W/m<sup>2</sup></span><a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#284><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> &ndash; and we haven&rsquo;t taken into account any of the energy losses in processing! </p><h3>Cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass</h3><p class="first">Cellulosic ethanol &ndash; the wonderful &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; biofuel? Schmer et al. (2008) found that the net energy yield of switchgrass grown over five years on marginal cropland on 10 farms in the midcontinental US was 60 GJ per hectare per year, which is <span class="green">0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. &ldquo;This is a baseline study that represents the genetic material and agronomic technology available for switchgrass production in 2000 and 2001, when the fields were planted. Improved genetics and agronomics may further enhance energy sustain- ability and biofuel yield of switchgrass.&rdquo; </p><h3>Jatropha also has low power per unit area</h3><p class="first">Jatropha is an oil-bearing crop that grows best in dry tropical regions (300&ndash; 1000 mm rain per year). It likes temperatures 20&ndash;28 &deg;C. The projected yield in hot countries on good land is 1600 litres of biodiesel per hectare per year. That&rsquo;s a power per unit area of 0.18 W/m<sup>2</sup>. On wasteland, the yield is 583 litres per hectare per year. That&rsquo;s 0.065 W/m<sup>2</sup>. </p><p>If people decided to use 10% of Africa to generate 0.065 W/m<sup>2</sup>, and shared this power between six billion people, what would we all get? <span class="green">0.8 kWh/d/p</span>. For comparison, world oil consumption is 80 million barrels per day, which, shared between six billion people, is <span class="red">23 kWh/d/p</span>. So even if <em>all</em> of Africa were covered with jatropha plantations, the power produced would be only one third of world oil consumption. </p><h3>What about algae?</h3><p class="first">Algae are just plants, so everything I&rsquo;ve said so far applies to algae. Slimy underwater plants are no more efficient at photosynthesis than their ter- restrial cousins.

It takes much less effort for plants to photosynthesize if the carbon dioxide has already been concentrated for them. In a sunny spot in America, in ponds fed with concentrated CO<sub>2</sub> (concentrated to 10%), Ron Putt of Auburn University says that algae can grow at 30 g per square metre per day, producing 0.01 litres of biodiesel per square metre per day. This corresponds to a power per unit pond area of <span class="green">4 W/m<sup>2</sup></span> &ndash; similar to the Bavaria photovoltaic farm. If you wanted to drive a typical car (doing 12 km per litre) a distance of 50 km per day, then you&rsquo;d need <span class="blue">420 square metres</span> of algae-ponds just to power your car; for comparison, the area of the UK per person is 4000 square metres, of which 69 m<sup>2</sup> is water (figure 6.8). Please don&rsquo;t forget that it&rsquo;s essential to feed these ponds with concentrated carbon dioxide. So this technology would be limited both by land area &ndash; how much of the UK we could turn into algal ponds &ndash; and by the availability of concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>, the capture of which would have an energy cost (a topic discussed in Chap- ters 23 and 31). Let&rsquo;s check the limit imposed by the concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>. To grow 30 g of algae per m<sup>2</sup> per day would require at least 60 g of CO<sub>2</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> per day (because the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule has more mass per carbon atom than the molecules in algae). If all the CO<sub>2</sub> from all UK power stations were captured (roughly 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tons per year per person), it could service <span class="blue">230 square metres</span> per person<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#285><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> of the algal ponds described above &ndash; roughly 6% of the country<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#285><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a>. This area would deliver biodiesel with a power of 24 kWh per day per person, assuming that the numbers for sunny America apply here. A plausible vision? Perhaps on one tenth of that scale? I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to decide. </p><h3>What about algae in the sea?</h3><p class="first">Remember what I just said: the algae-to-biodiesel posse always feed their algae concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>. If you&rsquo;re going out to sea, presumably pumping CO<sub>2</sub> into it won&rsquo;t be an option. And without the concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>, the productivity of algae drops 100-fold. For algae in the sea to make a difference, a country-sized harvesting area in the sea would be required. </p><h3>What about algae that produce hydrogen?</h3><p class="first">Trying to get slime to produce hydrogen in sunlight is a smart idea because it cuts out a load of chemical steps normally performed by carbohydrate- producing plants. Every chemical step reduces efficiency a little. Hydrogen can be produced directly by the photosynthetic system, right at step one. A research study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado predicted that a reactor filled with genetically-modified green algae, covering an area of 11 hectares in the Arizona desert, could </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">produce 300 kg of hydrogen per day. Hydrogen contains 39 kWh per kg, so this algae-to-hydrogen facility would deliver a power per unit area of 4.4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Taking into account the estimated electricity required to run the facility, the net power delivered would be reduced to <span class="green">3.6 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. That strikes me as still quite a promising number &ndash; compare it with the Bavarian solar photovoltaic farm, for example (<span class="green">5 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>). </p><h2>Food for humans or other animals</h2><p class="first">Grain crops such as wheat, oats, barley, and corn have an energy density of about 4 kWh per kg. In the UK, wheat yields of 7.7 tons per hectare per year are typical. If the wheat is eaten by an animal, the power per unit area of this process is 0.34 W/m<sup>2</sup>. If 2800 m<sup>2</sup><a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#286><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a> of Britain (that&rsquo;s all agricultural land) were devoted to the growth of crops like these, the chemical energy generated would be about <span class="green">24 kWh/d per person</span>. </p><h2>Incineration of agricultural by-products</h2><p class="first">We found a moment ago that the power per unit area of a biomass power station burning the best energy crops is 0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>. If instead we grow crops for food, and put the left-overs that we don&rsquo;t eat into a power station &ndash; or if we feed the food to chickens and put the left-overs that come out of the chickens&rsquo; back ends into a power station &ndash; what power could be delivered per unit area of farmland? Let&rsquo;s make a rough guess, then take a look at some real data. For a wild guess, let&rsquo;s imagine that by-products are harvested from half of the area of Britain (2000 m<sup>2</sup> per person) and trucked to power stations, and that general agricultural by-products deliver 10% as much power per unit area as the best energy crops: 0.02 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Multiplying this by 2000 m<sup>2</sup> we get <span class="green">1 kWh per day per person</span>. </p><p>Have I been unfair to agricultural garbage in making this wild guess? We can re-estimate the plausible production from agricultural left-overs by scaling up the prototype straw-burning power station at Elean in East Anglia. Elean&rsquo;s power output is 36 MW, and it uses 200 000 tons per year from land located within a 50-mile radius. If we assume this density can be replicated across the whole country, the Elean model offers 0.002 W/m<sup>2</sup>. At 4000 m<sup>2</sup> per person, that&rsquo;s 8 W per person, or <span class="green">0.2 kWh/day per person</span>. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s calculate this another way. UK straw production is 10 million tons per year, or 0.46 kg per day per person. At 4.2 kWh per kg, this straw has a chemical energy of 2 kWh per day per person. If all the straw were burned in 30%-efficient power stations &ndash; a proposal that wouldn&rsquo;t go down well with farm animals, who have other uses for straw &ndash; the electricity generated would be <span class="green">0.6 kWh/d per person</span>. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h3>Landfill methane gas</h3><p class="first">At present, much of the methane gas leaking out of rubbish tips comes from biological materials, especially waste food. So, as long as we keep throwing away things like food and newspapers, landfill gas is a sustainable energy source &ndash; plus, burning that methane might be a good idea from a climate-change perspective, since methane is a stronger greenhouse-gas than CO<sub>2</sub>. A landfill site receiving 7.5 million tons of household waste per year can generate 50 000 m<sup>3</sup> per hour of methane. </p><p>In 1994, landfill methane emissions were estimated to be 0.05 m<sup>3</sup> per person per day, which has a chemical energy of 0.5 kWh/d per person, and would generate <span class="green">0.2 kWh(e)/d per person</span>, if it were all converted to electricity with 40% efficiency. Landfill gas emissions are declining because of changes in legislation, and are now roughly 50% lower. </p><h3>Burning household waste</h3><p class="first">SELCHP (&ldquo;South East London Combined Heat and Power&rdquo;) [<span class="websitetitle">www.selchp. com</span>] is a 35 MW power station that is paid to burn 420 kt per year of black- bag waste from the London area. They burn the waste as a whole, without sorting. After burning, ferrous metals are removed for recycling, hazardous wastes are filtered out and sent to a special landfill site, and the remaining ash is sent for reprocessing into recycled material for road building or construction use. The calorific value of the waste is 2.5 kWh/kg, and the thermal efficiency of the power station is about 21%, so each 1 kg of waste gets turned into 0.5 kWh of electricity. The carbon emissions are about 1000 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh. Of the 35 MW generated, about 4 MW is used by the plant itself to run its machinery and filtering processes. </p><p>Scaling this idea up, if every borough had one of these, and if everyone sent 1 kg per day of waste, then we&rsquo;d get <span class="green">0.5 kWh(e) per day per person</span> from waste incineration. </p><p>This is similar to the figure estimated above for methane capture at landfill sites. And remember, we can&rsquo;t have both. More waste incineration means less methane gas leaking out of landfill sites. See figure 27.2, p206, and figure 27.3, p207, for further data on waste incineration. </p><h2>Notes and further reading</h2><div class="endnote"><p>page no. </p><div class="notes"><p><span class="mark">283</span><em class="darkred">The power per unit area of using willow, miscanthus, or poplar, for electricity is 0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup></em>.

The two dominant reasons why buildings lose heat are: </p><ol><li><strong>Conduction</strong> &ndash; heat flowing directly through walls, windows and doors; </li><li><strong>Ventilation</strong> &ndash; hot air trickling out through cracks, gaps, or deliberate ventilation ducts. </li></ol><p class="first">In the standard model for heat loss, both these heat flows are proportional to the temperature difference between the air inside and outside. For a typical British house, conduction is the bigger of the two losses, as we&rsquo;ll see. </p><h3>Conduction loss</h3><p class="first">The rate of conduction of heat through a wall, ceiling, floor, or window is the product of three things: the area of the wall, a measure of conductivity of the wall known in the trade as the &ldquo;U-value&rdquo; or thermal transmittance, and the temperature difference &ndash; </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 5em">power loss = area &times; <em>U</em> &times; temperature difference.</p><p class="first">The U-value is usually measured in W/m<sup>2</sup>/K.

Double-glazing is about as good as a solid brick wall.

From duration to duration, the temperature difference changes, but the Somethings don&rsquo;t change. When predicting a space&rsquo;s total energy loss due to conduction and ventilation over a long period we thus need to multiply two things: </p><ol><li>the sum of all the <span class="darkblue">Somethings</span> (adding <span class="darkblue">area &times; <em>U</em></span> for all walls, roofs, floors, doors, and windows, and <span class="darkblue"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> <em>NV</em></span> for the volume); and </li><li>the sum of all the Temperature difference &times; duration factors (for all the durations). </li></ol><p class="first">The first factor is a property of the building measured in watts per &deg;C.

The lost energy is replen- ished by the building&rsquo;s heating system, and by other sources of energy such as the occupants, their gadgets, their cookers, and the sun. Focussing on the heating system, the energy <em>delivered</em> by the heating is not the same as the energy <em>consumed</em> by the heating. They are related by the <em>coefficient of performance</em> of the heating system. </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 1em">energy consumed = energy delivered/coefficient of performance.</p><p class="first">For a condensing boiler burning natural gas, for example, the coefficient of performance is 90%, because 10% of the energy is lost up the chimney. </p><p>To summarise, we can reduce the energy consumption of a building in three ways: </p><ol><li>by reducing temperature demand; </li><li>by reducing leakiness; or </li><li>by increasing the coefficient of performance. </li></ol><p class="first">We now quantify the potential of these options.

Raising the summer thermostat from 20 &deg;C to 23 &deg;C reduces the temperature demand of cooling by 82%, from 91 to 16 degree-days.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h3>Temperature demand</h3><p class="first">We can visualize the temperature demand nicely on a graph of external temperature versus time (figure E.4). For a building held at a temperature of 20 &deg;C, the total temperature demand is the <em>area</em> between the horizontal line at 20 &deg;C and the external temperature. In figure E.4a, we see that, for one year in Cambridge, holding the temperature at 20 &deg;C year-round had a temperature demand of 3188 degree-days of heating and 91 degree-days of cooling. These pictures allow us easily to assess the effect of turning down the thermostat and living without air-conditioning. Turning the winter thermostat down to 17 &deg;C, the temperature demand for heating drops from 3188 degree-days to 2265 degree-days (figure E.4b), which corresponds to a 30% reduction in heating demand. Turning the thermostat down to 15 &deg;C reduces the temperature demand from 3188 to 1748 degree days, a 45% reduction. </p><p>These calculations give us a ballpark indication of the benefit of turning down thermostats, but will give an exact prediction only if we take into account two details: first, buildings naturally absorb energy from the sun, boosting the inside above the outside temperature, even without any heat- ing; and second, the occupants and their gadget companions emit heat, so further cutting down the artificial heating requirements. The temper- ature demand of a location, as conventionally expressed in degree-days, is a bit of an unwieldy thing. I find it hard to remember numbers like &ldquo;3500degree-days.&rdquo; And academics may find the degree-day a distressing unit, since they already have another meaning for degree days (one involving dressing up in gowns and mortar boards). We can make this quantity more meaningful and perhaps easier to work with by dividing it by 365, the number of days in the year, obtaining the temperature demand in &ldquo;degree-days per day,&rdquo; or, if you prefer, in plain &ldquo;degrees.&rdquo; Figure E.6 shows this replotted temperature demand. Expressed this way, the tem- perature demand is simply the <em>average</em> temperature difference between in- side and outside. The highlighted temperature demands are: 8.7 &deg;C, for a thermostat setting of 20 &deg;C; 6.2 &deg;C, for a setting of 17 &deg;C; and 4.8 &deg;C, for a setting of 15 &deg;C. </p><h3>Leakiness &ndash; example: my house</h3><p class="first">My house is a three-bedroom semi-detached house built about 1940 (figure E.7). By 2006, its kitchen had been slightly extended, and most of the windows were double-glazed. The front door and back door were both still single-glazed. </p><p>My estimate of the leakiness in 2006 is built up as shown in table E.8. The total leakiness of the house was 322 W/&deg;C (or 7.7 kWh/d/.C), with conductive leakiness accounting for 72% and ventilation leakiness for 28% of the total. The conductive leakiness is roughly equally divided into three parts: windows; walls; and floor and ceiling. </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure289.png" width="200" height="241" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.6.</span> The temperature demand in Cambridge, 2006, replotted in units of degree-days per day, also known as degrees.

The improved loft insulation (new U-value 0.3) should reduce the leakiness by 14 W/&deg;C. The glazing modi- fications (new U-value 1.6&ndash;1.8) should reduce the conductive leakiness by 23 W/&deg;C, and the ventilation leakiness by something like 24 W/&deg;C. That&rsquo;s a total reduction in leakiness of 25%, from roughly 320 to 240 W/&deg;C (7.7 to 6 kWh/d/&deg;C). Table E.9 shows the predicted savings from each of the modifications. </p><p>The heat-loss parameter of this house (total floor area 88 m<sup>2</sup>) is thus hopefully reduced by about 25%, from 3.7 to 2.7 W/&deg;C/m<sup>2</sup>.

As we saw a moment ago, a much easier way of achieving a big dent in heat loss is to turn the thermostat down. Turning down from 20 to 17 &deg;C gave a reduction in heat loss of 30%. </p><p>Combining these two actions &ndash; the physical modifications and the turn- ing-down of the thermostat &ndash; this model predicts that heat loss should be reduced by nearly 50%. Since some heat is generated in a house by sunshine, gadgets, and humans, the reduction in gas consumption should be more than 50%. </p><p>I made all these changes to my house and monitored my meters every week. I can confirm that my heating bill indeed went down by more than 50%. As figure 21.4 showed, my gas consumption has gone down from 40 kWh/d to 13 kWh/d &ndash; a reduction of 67%. </p><h5>Leakiness reduction by internal wall-coverings</h5><p class="first">Can you reduce your walls&rsquo; leakiness by covering the <em>inside</em> of the wall with insulation? The answer is yes, but there may be two complications. First, the thickness of internal covering is bigger than you might expect. To transform an existing nine-inch solid brick wall (U-value 2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K) into a decent 0.30 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K wall, roughly 6 cm of insulated lining board is required. [<span class="tinylink">65h3cb</span>] Second, condensation may form on the hidden surface of such internal insulation layers, leading to damp problems. </p><p>If you&rsquo;re not looking for such a big reduction in wall leakiness, you can get by with a thinner internal covering. For example, you can buy 1.8-cm- thick insulated wallboards with a U-value of 1.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K. With these over the existing wall, the U-value would be reduced from 2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K to: </p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 8em" src="E207.png" width="209" height="44" alt=""></div><p class="first">Definitely a worthwhile reduction.</p><h2>Air-exchange</h2><p class="first">Once a building is really well insulated, the principal loss of heat will be through ventilation (air changes) rather than through conduction. The heat loss through ventilation can be reduced by transferring the heat from the outgoing air to the incoming air. Remarkably, a great deal of this heat can indeed be transferred without any additional energy being required. The trick is to use a nose, as discovered by natural selection. A nose warms incoming air by cooling down outgoing air. There&rsquo;s a temperature gradient along the nose; the walls of a nose are coldest near the nostrils. The longer your nose, the better it works as a counter-current heat exchanger. In nature&rsquo;s noses, the direction of the air-flow usually alternates. Another way to organize a nose is to have two air-passages, one for in-flow and </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">one for out-flow, separate from the point of view of air, but tightly coupled with each other so that heat can easily flow between the two passages. This is how the noses work in buildings. It&rsquo;s conventional to call these noses heat-exchangers. </p><h2>An energy-efficient house</h2><p class="first">In 1984, an energy consultant, Alan Foster, built an energy-efficient house near Cambridge; he kindly gave me his thorough measurements. The house is a timber-framed bungalow based on a Scandinavian &ldquo;Heatkeeper Serrekunda&rdquo; design (figure E.10), with a floor area of 140 m<sup>2</sup>, composed of three bedrooms, a study, two bathrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a lobby. The wooden outside walls were supplied in kit form by a Scottish company, and the main parts of the house took only a few days to build. </p><p>The walls are 30 cm thick and have a U-value of 0.28 W/m<sup>2</sup>/&deg;C. From the inside out, they consist of 13 mm of plasterboard, 27 mm airspace, a vapour barrier, 8 mm of plywood, 90 mm of rockwool, 12 mm of bitumen- impregnated fibreboard, 50 mm cavity, and 103 mm of brick. The ceiling construction is similar with 100&ndash;200 mm of rockwool insulation. The ceil- ing has a U-value of 0.27 W/m<sup>2</sup>/&deg;C, and the floor, 0.22 W/m<sup>2</sup>/&deg;C. The windows are double-glazed (U-value 2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/&deg;C), with the inner panes&rsquo; outer surfaces specially coated to reduce radiation. The windows are ar- ranged to give substantial solar gain, contributing about 30% of the house&rsquo;s space-heating. </p><p>The house is well sealed, every door and window lined with neoprene gaskets. The house is heated by warm air pumped through floor grilles; in winter, pumps remove used air from several rooms, exhausting it to the outside, and they take in air from the loft space. The incoming air and outgoing air pass through a heat exchanger (figure E.11), which saves 60% of the heat in the extracted air. The heat exchanger is a passive device, using no energy: it&rsquo;s like a big metal nose, warming the incoming air with the outgoing air.

It has solar panels for hot water, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels generating up to 6.5 kW of electricity, and is heated by a 14-kW ground- source heat pump and occasionally by a wood stove. The floor area is 400m<sup>2</sup> and the number of occupants is about 30. It is a single-storey build- ing. The walls contain 300mm of rockwool insulation. The heat pump&rsquo;s coefficient of performance in winter was 2.5. The energy used is 65 kWh per year per square metre of floor area (<span class="red">7.4 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>). The PV system delivers almost 20% of this energy. </p><h3>Contemporary offices</h3><p class="first">New office buildings are often hyped up as being amazingly environment- friendly. Let&rsquo;s look at some numbers. </p><p>The William Gates building at Cambridge University holds computer science researchers, administrators, and a small caf&eacute;. Its area is 11 110 m<sup>2</sup>, and its energy consumption is 2392 MWh/y. That&rsquo;s a power per unit area of 215 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/y, or <span class="red">25 W/m<sup>2</sup></span>. This building won a RIBA award in 2001 for its predicted energy consumption. &ldquo;The architects have incorporated many environmentally friendly features into the building.&rdquo; [<span class="tinylink">5dhups</span>] </p><p>But are these buildings impressive? Next door, the Rutherford building, built in the 1970s without any fancy eco-claims &ndash; indeed without even double glazing &ndash; has a floor area of 4998 m<sup>2</sup> and consumes 1557 MWh per year; that&rsquo;s 0.85 kWh/d/m<sup>2</sup>, or 36 W/m<sup>2</sup>. So the award-winning building is just 30% better, in terms of power per unit area, than its simple 1970s cousin.

For all the fanfare, the difference between the new and the old is really quite disappointing! </p><p>Notice that the building power consumptions, per unit floor area, are in just the same units (W/m<sup>2</sup>) as the renewable powers per unit area that we discussed on pages 43, 47, and 177. Comparing these consumption and production numbers helps us realize how difficult it is to power modern buildings entirely from on-site renewables. The power per unit area of biofuels (figure 6.11, p43) is 0.5 W/m<sup>2</sup>; of wind farms, 2 W/m<sup>2</sup>; of solar photovoltaics, 20 W/m<sup>2</sup> (figure 6.18, p47); only solar hot-water panels come in at the right sort of power per unit area, 53 W/m<sup>2</sup> (figure 6.3, p39). </p><h2>Improving the coefficient of performance</h2><p class="first">You might think that the coefficient of performance of a condensing boiler, 90%, sounds pretty hard to beat. But it can be significantly improved upon, by heat pumps. Whereas the condensing boiler takes chemical energy and turns 90% of it into useful heat, the heat pump takes some electrical energy and uses it to <em>move</em> heat from one place to another (for example, from outside a building to inside). Usually the amount of useful heat delivered is much bigger than the amount of electricity used. A coefficient of performance of 3 or 4 is normal. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:26em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.13.</span> Ideal heat pump efficiencies.

Notice that the ideal efficiency is bigger, the closer the inside temperature <em>T</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>2</sub></span> is to the outside temperature <em>T</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>1</sub></span>. </p><p>While in theory ground-source heat pumps might have better perfor- mance than air-source, because the ground temperature is usually closer than the air temperature to the indoor temperature, in practice an air- source heat pump might be the best and simplest choice. In cities, there may be uncertainty about the future effectiveness of ground-source heat pumps, because the more people use them in winter, the colder the ground gets; this thermal fly-tipping problem may also show up in the summer in cities where too many buildings use ground-source (or should I say &ldquo;ground-sink&rdquo;?) heat pumps for air-conditioning. </p><h2>Heating and the ground</h2><p class="first">Here&rsquo;s an interesting calculation to do. Imagine having solar heating pan- els on your roof, and, whenever the water in the panels gets above 50 &deg;C, pumping the water through a large rock under your house. When a dreary grey cold month comes along, you could then use the heat in the rock to warm your house. Roughly how big a 50 &deg;C rock would you need to hold enough energy to heat a house for a whole month? Let&rsquo;s assume we&rsquo;re after 24 kWh per day for 30 days and that the house is at 16 &deg;C. The heat capacity of granite is 0.195 &times; 4200 J/kg/K = 820 J/kg/K. The mass of granite required is: </p><div><img style="margin:0em 0 0em 5em" src="E211.png" width="322" height="98" alt=""></div><p class="first">100 tonnes, which corresponds to a cuboid of rock of size 6 m &times; 6 m &times; 1 m. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:35em"><table class="framed" id="p301" summary=""><tr class="top"><td>Heat capacity:</td><td><em>C</em> = 820 J/kg/K</td></tr><tr><td>Conductivity:</td><td><em>&kappa;</em> = 2.1 W/m/K</td></tr><tr><td>Density:</td><td><em>&rho;</em> = 2750 kg/m<sup>3</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Heat capacity per unit volume:</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><em>C</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>V</sub></span> = 2.3 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>/K</td></tr></table><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Table E.14.</span> Vital statistics for granite.

But is it difficult to keep the heat in? Would you need to surround your rock cuboid with lots of insulation? It turns out that the ground itself is a pretty good insulator. A spike of heat put down a hole in the ground will spread as </p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 9em" src="E212.png" width="182" height="47" alt=""></div><p class="first">where <em>&kappa;</em> is the conductivity of the ground, <em>C</em> is its heat capacity, and <em>&rho;</em> is its density. This describes a bell-shaped curve with width </p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 13em" src="E214.png" width="59" height="44" alt=""></div><p class="first">for example, after six months (<em>t</em> = 1.6 &times; 10<sup>7</sup> s), using the figures for granite (<em>C</em> = 0.82 kJ/kg/K, <em>&rho;</em> = 2500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, <em>&kappa;</em> = 2.1 W/m/K), the width is 6 m. </p><p>Using the figures for water (<em>C</em> = 4.2 kJ/kg/K, <em>&rho;</em> = 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, <em>&kappa;</em> = 0.6 W/m/K), the width is 2 m. </p><p>So if the storage region is bigger than 20 m &times; 20 m &times; 20 m then most of the heat stored will still be there in six months time (because 20 m is significantly bigger than 6 m and 2 m). </p><h3>Limits of ground-source heat pumps</h3><p class="first">The low thermal conductivity of the ground is a double-edged sword. Thanks to low conductivity, the ground holds heat well for a long time. But on the other hand, low conductivity means that it&rsquo;s not easy to shove heat in and out of the ground rapidly. We now explore how the conductivity of the ground limits the use of ground-source heat pumps. </p><p>Consider a neighbourhood with quite a high population density. Can <em>everyone</em> use ground-source heat pumps, without using active summer re- plenishment (as discussed on p152)? The concern is that if we all sucked heat from the ground at the same time, we might freeze the ground solid. I&rsquo;m going to address this question by two calculations. First, I&rsquo;ll work out the natural flux of energy in and out of the ground in summer and winter. </p><img style="margin:2em 0 1em 1em" src="figure295.png" width="408" height="132" alt=""><div class="imgcap" style="top:1em"><table class="framed" id="p302" summary=""><tr><th colspan="2">(W/m/K)</th></tr><tr><td>water</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>quartz</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>granite</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>earth&#39;s crust</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>dry soil</td><td>0.14</td></tr></table><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Table E.15.</span> Thermal conductivities.

The average temperature is 11.5 &deg;C.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">If the flux we want to suck out of the ground in winter is much bigger than these natural fluxes then we know that our sucking is going to signif- icantly alter ground temperatures, and may thus not be feasible. For this calculation, I&rsquo;ll assume the ground just below the surface is held, by the combined influence of sun, air, cloud, and night sky, at a temperature that varies slowly up and down during the year (figure E.16). </p><h3>Response to external temperature variations</h3><p class="first">Working out how the temperature inside the ground responds, and what the flux in or out is, requires some advanced mathematics, which I&rsquo;ve cordoned off in box E.19 (p306). </p><p>The payoff from this calculation is a rather beautiful diagram (figure E.17) that shows how the temperature varies in time at each depth. This diagram shows the answer for any material in terms of the <em>character- istic length-scale</em> <em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span> (equation (E.7)), which depends on the conductivity <em>&kappa;</em> and heat capacity <em>C</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>V</sub></span> of the material, and on the frequency <em>&omega;</em> of the external temperature variations. (We can choose to look at either daily and yearly variations using the same theory.) At a depth of 2<em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span>, the variations in temperature are one seventh of those at the surface, and lag them by about one third of a cycle (figure E.17). At a depth of 3<em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span>, the variations in temperature are one twentieth of those at the surface, and lag them by half a cycle. </p><p>For the case of daily variations and solid granite, the characteristic length-scale is <em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span> = 0.16 m. (So 32 cm of rock is the thickness you need to ride out external daily temperature oscillations.) For yearly variations and solid granite, the characteristic length-scale is <em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span> = 3 m. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s focus on annual variations and discuss a few other materials. Characteristic length-scales for various materials are in the third column of table E.18. For damp sandy soils or concrete, the characteristic length- scale <em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span> is similar to that of granite &ndash; about 2.6 m. In dry or peaty soils, the length-scale <em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span> is shorter &ndash; about 1.3 m. That&rsquo;s perhaps good news because it means you don&rsquo;t have to dig so deep to find ground with a stable tem- perature. But it&rsquo;s also coupled with some bad news: the natural fluxes are smaller in dry soils. </p><p>The natural flux varies during the year and has a peak value (equation (E.9)) that is smaller, the smaller the conductivity. </p><p>For the case of solid granite, the peak flux is 8 W/m<sup>2</sup>. For dry soils, the peak flux ranges from 0.7 W/m<sup>2</sup> to 2.3 W/m<sup>2</sup>. For damp soils, the peak flux ranges from 3 W/m<sup>2</sup> to 8 W/m<sup>2</sup>. </p><p>What does this mean? I suggest we take a flux in the middle of these numbers, 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as a useful benchmark, giving guidance about what sort of power we could expect to extract, per unit area, with a ground- source heat pump. If we suck a flux significantly smaller than 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, the perturbation we introduce to the natural flows will be small. If on the </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:10em"><img src="figure296.png" width="219" height="201" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure E.17.</span> Temperature (in &deg;C) versus depth and time. The depths are given in units of the characteristic depth <em>z</em><span class="smallsub"><sub>0</sub></span>, which for granite and annual variations is 3 m.  At &ldquo;depth 2&rdquo; (6 m), the temperature is always about 11 or 12 &deg;C. At &ldquo;depth 1&rdquo; (3 m), it wobbles between 8 and 15&nbsp;&deg;C.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">(typical of damp clay soil),</p><div><img style="margin:1em 0 1em 9em" src="E218.png" width="173" height="40" alt=""></div><p class="first">If, as above, we assume a population density corresponding to 160 m<sup>2</sup> per person, then the maximum power per person deliverable by ground-source heat pumps, if everyone in a neighbourhood has them, is 480 W, which is 12 kWh/d per person. </p><p>So again we come to the conclusion that in a typical suburban area composed of poorly insulated houses like mine, <em>not everyone can use ground- source heat pumps</em>, unless they are careful to actively dump heat back into the ground during the summer. And in cities with higher population density, ground-source heat pumps are unlikely to be viable. </p><p>I therefore suggest air-source heat pumps are the best heating choice for most people. </p><h2>Thermal mass</h2><p class="first">Does increasing the thermal mass of a building help reduce its heating and cooling bills? It depends. The outdoor temperature can vary during the day by about 10 &deg;C. A building with large thermal mass &ndash; thick stone walls, for example &ndash; will naturally ride out those variations in temperature, and, without heating or cooling, will have a temperature close to the average outdoor temperature. Such buildings, in the UK, need neither heating nor cooling for many months of the year. In contrast, a poorly-insulated building with low thermal mass might be judged too hot during the day and too cool at night, leading to greater expenditure on cooling and heating. </p><p>However, large thermal mass is not always a boon. If a room is occupied in winter for just a couple of hours a day (think of a lecture room for example), the energy cost of warming the room up to a comfortable temperature will be greater, the greater the room&rsquo;s thermal mass. This extra invested heat will linger for longer in a thermally massive room, but if nobody is there to enjoy it, it&rsquo;s wasted heat. So in the case of infrequently-used rooms it makes sense to aim for a structure with low thermal mass, and to warm that small mass rapidly when required. </p><h2>Notes and further reading</h2><div class="endnote">page no. <div class="notes"><p><span class="mark">304</span><em class="darkred">Table E.18.</em> Sources: Bonan (2002), <span class="websitetitle">www.hukseflux.com/thermalScience/thermalConductivity.html</span> </p></div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h1 class="green">F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waves II</h1><h2>The physics of deep-water waves</h2><p class="first">Waves contain energy in two forms: potential energy, and kinetic energy. The potential energy is the energy required to move all the water from the troughs to the crests. The kinetic energy is associated with the water moving around. </p><p>People sometimes assume that when the crest of a wave moves across an ocean at 30miles per hour, the water in that crest must also be moving at 30miles per hour in the same direction. But this isn&rsquo;t so. It&rsquo;s just like a Mexican wave. When the wave rushes round the stadium, the humans who are making the wave aren&rsquo;t themselves moving round the stadium: they just bob up and down a little. The motion of a piece of water in the ocean is similar: if you focused on a bit of seaweed floating in the water as waves go by, you&rsquo;d see that the seaweed moves up and down, and also a little to and fro in the direction of travel of the wave &ndash; the exact effect could be recreated in a Mexican wave if people moved like window- cleaners, polishing a big piece of glass in a circular motion. The wave has potential energy because of the elevation of the crests above the troughs. And it has kinetic energy because of the small circular bobbing motion of the water. </p><p>Our rough calculation of the power in ocean waves will require three ingredients: an estimate of the period <em>T</em> of the waves (the time between crests), an estimate of the height <em>h</em> of the waves, and a physics formula that tells us how to work out the speed <em>v</em> of the wave from its period. </p><p>The wavelength <em>&lambda;</em> and period of the waves (the distance and time re- spectively between two adjacent crests) depend on the speed of the wind that creates the waves, as shown in figure F.1. The height of the waves doesn&rsquo;t depend on the windspeed; rather, it depends on how long the wind has been caressing the water surface. </p><p>You can estimate the period of ocean waves by recalling the time be- tween waves arriving on an ocean beach. Is 10 seconds reasonable? For the height of ocean waves, let&rsquo;s assume an amplitude of 1 m, which means 2 m from trough to crest. In waves this high, a man in a dinghy can&rsquo;t see beyond the nearest crest when he&rsquo;s in a trough; I think this height is bigger than average, but we can revisit this estimate if we decide it&rsquo;s important. The speed of deep-water waves is related to the time <em>T</em> between crests by the physics formula (see Faber (1995), p170): </p><img style="margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 13em" src="E226.png" width="61" height="40" alt=""><p class="first">where <em>g</em> is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>).

Stephen Salter&rsquo;s &ldquo;duck&rdquo; has been well characterized: a row of 16-m diameter ducks, feeding off Atlantic waves with an average power of 45 kW/m, would deliver 19 kW/m, including transmission to central Scotland (Mollison, 1986). </p><p>The Pelamis device, created by Ocean Power Delivery, has taken over the Salter duck&rsquo;s mantle as the leading floating deep-water wave device. Each snake-like device is 130 m long and is made of a chain of four segments, each 3.5 m in diameter. It has a maximum power output of 750 kW. The Pelamises are designed to be moored in a depth of about 50 m. In a wavefarm, 39 devices in three rows would face the principal wave direction, occupying an area of ocean, about 400 m long and 2.5 km wide (an area of 1 km<sup>2</sup>). The effective cross-section of a single Pelamis is 7 m (i.e., for good waves, it extracts 100% of the energy that would cross 7 m). The company says that such a wave-farm would deliver about 10 kW/m. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h3>Shallow-water devices</h3><p class="first">Typically 70% of energy in ocean waves is lost through bottom-friction as the depth decreases from 100 m to 15 m. So the average wave-power per unit length of coastline in shallow waters is reduced to about 12 kW/m. The Oyster, developed by Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast and Aquamarine Power Ltd [<span class="websitetitle">www.aquamarinepower.com</span>], is a bottom-mounted flap, about 12 m high, that is intended to be deployed in waters about 12 m deep, in areas where the average incident wave power is greater than 15 kW/m. Its peak power is 600 kW. A single device would produce about 270 kW in wave heights greater than 3.5 m. It&rsquo;s predicted that an Oyster would have a bigger power per unit mass of hardware than a Pelamis. </p><p>Oysters could also be used to directly drive reverse-osmosis desalina- tion facilities. &ldquo;The peak freshwater output of an Oyster desalinator is between 2000 and 6000 m<sup>3</sup>/day.&rdquo; That production has a value, going by the Jersey facility (which uses 8 kWh per m<sup>3</sup>), equivalent to 600&ndash;2000 kW of electricity. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h1 class="green">G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tide II</h1><h2>Power density of tidal pools</h2><p class="first">To estimate the power of an artificial tide-pool, imagine that it&rsquo;s filled rapidly at high tide, and emptied rapidly at low tide. Power is generated in both directions, on the ebb and on the flood. (This is called two-way generation or double-effect generation.) The change in potential energy of the water, each six hours, is <em>mgh</em>, where <em>h</em> is the change in height of the centre of mass of the water, which is half the range. (The range is the difference in height between low and high tide; figure G.1.) The mass per unit area covered by tide-pool is <em>&rho;</em> &times; (2<em>h</em>), where <em>&rho;</em> is the density of water (1000 kg/m<em>3</em>). So the power per unit area generated by a tide-pool is </p><table style="margin:1em 0 1em 12em" class="fraction"><tr><td>2<em>&rho;hgh</em></td><td rowspan="2">,</td></tr><tr><td class="upper_line">6 hours</td></tr></table><p class="first">assuming perfectly efficient generators. Plugging in <em>h</em> = 2 m (i.e., range 4 m), we find the power per unit area of tide-pool is 3.6 W/m<em>2</em>. Allowing for an efficiency of 90% for conversion of this power to electricity, we get </p><p style="margin:1em 0 1em 4em">power per unit area of tide-pool&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="cong">&#8773;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">3 W/m<em>2</em></span>.</p><p class="first">So to generate 1 GW of power (on average), we need a tide-pool with an area of about 300 km<em>2</em>. A circular pool with diameter 20 km would do the trick. (For comparison, the area of the Severn estuary behind the proposed barrage is about 550 km<em>2</em>, and the area of the Wash is more than 400 km<em>2</em>. </p><p>If a tide-pool produces electricity in one direction only, the power per unit area is halved. The average power density of the tidal barrage at La Rance, where the mean tidal range is 10.9 m, has been <span class="green">2.7 W/m<em>2</em></span> for decades (p87). </p><h2>The raw tidal resource</h2><p class="first">The tides around Britain are genuine tidal waves. (Tsunamis, which are called &ldquo;tidal waves,&rdquo; have nothing to do with tides: they are caused by underwater landslides and earthquakes.) The location of the high tide (the crest of the tidal wave) moves much faster than the tidal flow &ndash; 100 miles per hour, say, while the water itself moves at just 1 mile per hour. </p><p>The energy we can extract from tides, using tidal pools or tide farms, can never be more than the energy of these tidal waves from the Atlantic. We can estimate the total power of these great Atlantic tidal waves in the same way that we estimate the power of ordinary wind-generated waves. The next section describes a standard model for the power arriving in </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure299.png" width="214" height="132" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure G.1.</span> A tide-pool in cross section.

If <em>d</em> = 100 m, and <em>h</em> = 1 or 2 m, the power per unit length of wave crest is 150 kW/m or 600 kW/m respectively. These figures are impressive compared with the raw power per unit length of ordinary Atlantic deep-  water waves, 40 kW/m (Chapter F). Atlantic waves and the Atlantic tide have similar vertical amplitudes (about 1 m), but the raw power in tides is roughly 10 times bigger than that of ordinary wind-driven waves. </p><p>Taylor (1920) worked out a more detailed model of tidal power that includes important details such as the Coriolis effect (the effect produced by the earth&rsquo;s daily rotation), the existence of tidal waves travelling in the opposite direction, and the direct effect of the moon on the energy flow in the Irish Sea. Since then, experimental measurements and computer models have verified and extended Taylor&rsquo;s analysis. Flather (1976) built a detailed numerical model of the lunar tide, chopping the continental shelf around the British Isles into roughly 1000 square cells. Flather estimated that the total average power entering this region is 215 GW. According to his model, 180 GW enters the gap between France and Ireland. From Northern Ireland round to Shetland, the incoming power is 49 GW. Be- tween Shetland and Norway there is a net loss of 5 GW. As shown in figure G.4, Cartwright et al. (1980) found experimentally that the average power transmission was 60 GW between Malin Head (Ireland) and Flor&oslash; (Norway) and 190 GW between Valentia (Ireland) and the Brittany coast near Ouessant. The power entering the Irish Sea was found to be 45 GW, and entering the North Sea via the Dover Straits, 16.7 GW. </p><h3>The power of tidal waves</h3><p class="first">This section, which can safely be skipped, provides more details behind the formula for tidal power used in the previous section.

Just like a deep-water wave, the wave has energy in two forms: potential energy associated with raising water out of the light-shaded troughs into the heavy-shaded crests; and kinetic energy of all the water moving around as indicated by the small arrows. The speed of the wave, travelling from left to right, is indicated by the much bigger arrow at the top. For tidal waves, a typical depth might be 100 m, the crest velocity 30 m/s, the vertical amplitude at the surface 1 or 2&nbsp;m, and the water velocity amplitude 0.3 or 0.6&nbsp;m/s.</div></div><div class="imgcap" style="top:38em"><table class="framed" id="p312" summary=""><tr><th><em>h</em> (m)</th><th><em>&rho;g</em><sup>3/2</sup>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline"><em>d</em></span><em>h</em><sup>2</sup>/2 (kW/m)</th></tr><tr><td>0.9</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>1.2</td><td>220</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>345</td></tr><tr><td>1.75</td><td>470</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>600</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>2.25</td><td>780</td></tr></table><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Table G.3.</span> Power fluxes (power per unit length of wave crest) for depth d&nbsp;=&nbsp;100 m.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img style="margin:0em 0 2em 0" src="figure302.png" width="706" height="172" alt=""><p class="first">the power of the wave will remain constant.

One neglected detail is the Coriolis effect. The Coriolis force causes tidal crests and troughs to tend to drive on the right &ndash; for example, going up the English Channel, the high tides are higher and the low tides are lower on the French side of the channel. By neglecting this effect I may have introduced some error into the estimates. </p><h2>Power density of tidal stream farms</h2><p class="first">Imagine sticking underwater windmills on the sea-bed. The flow of water will turn the windmills. Because the density of water is roughly 1000 times that of air, the power of water flow is 1000 times greater than the power of wind at the same speed. </p><p>What power could tidal stream farms extract? It depends crucially on whether or not we can add up the power contributions of tidefarms on <em>adjacent</em> pieces of sea-floor. For wind, this additivity assumption is believed to work fine: as long as the wind turbines are spaced a standard distance apart from each other, the total power delivered by 10 adjacent wind farms is the sum of the powers that each would deliver if it were alone. </p><p>Does the same go for tide farms? Or do underwater windmills interfere with each other&rsquo;s power extraction in a different way? I don&rsquo;t think the answer to this question is known in general. We can name two alternative assumptions, however, and identify cartoon situations in which each assumption seems valid. The &ldquo;tide is like wind&rdquo; assumption says that you can put tide-turbines all over the sea-bed, spaced about 5 diameters apart from each other, and they won&rsquo;t interfere with each other, no matter how much of the sea-bed you cover with such tide farms. </p><p>The &ldquo;you can have only one row&rdquo; assumption, in contrast, asserts that the maximum power extractable in a region is the power that would be delivered by a <em>single</em> row of turbines facing the flow. A situation where this assumption is correct is the special case of a hydroelectric dam: if the water from the dam passes through a single well-designed turbine, there&rsquo;s no point putting any more turbines behind that one. You can&rsquo;t get 100 </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:13em"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure G.5.</span> (a) Tidal current over a 21-day period at a location where the maximum current at spring tide is 2.9 knots (1.5 m/s) and the maximum current at neap tide is 1.8&nbsp;knots (0.9&nbsp;m/s).

The oomph gets extracted by the first one, and there isn&rsquo;t any more oomph left for the others. The &ldquo;you can have only one row&rdquo; assumption is the right assumption for estimating the extractable power in a place where water flows through a narrow channel from approximately stationary water at one height into another body of water at a lower height. (This case is analysed by Garrett and Cummins (2005, 2007).) </p><p>I&rsquo;m now going to nail my colours to a mast. I think that in many places round the British Isles, the &ldquo;tide is like wind&rdquo; assumption is a good approximation. Perhaps some spots have some of the character of a narrow channel. In those spots, my estimates may be over-estimates. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s assume that the rules for laying out a sensible tide farm will be similar to those for wind farms, and that the efficiency of the tidemills will be like that of the best windmills, about 1/2. We can then steal the formula for the power of a wind farm (per unit land area) from p265. The power per unit sea-floor area is </p><table style="margin:1em 0 1em 8em;" id="p316" summary=""><tr><td>power per tidemill</td><td rowspan="2">&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td><em>&pi;</em></td><td>1</td><td rowspan="2"><em>&rho;U</em><sup>3</sup></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#316><font style="color:blue"><sup><abbr title="See errata"><b>E</b></abbr></sup></font></a></td></tr><tr><td class="upper_line">area per tidemill</td><td class="upper_line">200</td><td class="upper_line">2</td></tr></table><p class="first">Using this formula, table G.6 shows this tide farm power for a few tidal currents. </p><p>Now, what are typical tidal currents? Tidal charts usually give the currents associated with the tides with the largest range (called spring tides) and the tides with the smallest range (called neap tides). Spring tides occur shortly after each full moon and each new moon. Neap tides occur shortly after the first and third quarters of the moon. The power of a tide farm would vary throughout the day in a completely predictable manner. Figure G.5 illustrates the variation of power density of a tide farm with a maximum current of 1.5 m/s. The average power density of this tide farm would be 6.4 W/m<sup>2</sup>. There are many places around the British Isles where the power per unit area of tide farm would be 6 W/m<sup>2</sup> or more. This power density is similar to our estimates of the power densities of wind farms (2&ndash;3 W/m<sup>2</sup>) and of photovoltaic solar farms (5&ndash;10 W/m<sup>2</sup>). </p><p>We&rsquo;ll now use this &ldquo;tide farms are like wind farms&rdquo; theory to estimate the extractable power from tidal streams in promising regions around the British Isles. As a sanity check, we&rsquo;ll also work out the total tidal power crossing each of these regions, using the &ldquo;power of tidal waves&rdquo; theory, to check our tide farm&rsquo;s estimated power isn&rsquo;t bigger than the total power available. The main locations around the British Isles where tidal currents are large are shown in figure G.7. </p><p>I estimated the typical peak currents at six locations with large currents by looking at tidal charts in <em>Reed&rsquo;s Nautical Almanac</em>. (These estimates could easily be off by 30%.) Have I over-estimated or under-estimated the area of each region?

Table G.11 gives the power delivered if the boost height is set to <em>h</em>, that is, the range in the pool is just double the external range. A doubling of vertical range is easy at neap tides, since neap tides are typically about half as high as spring tides. Pumping the pool at neaps so that the full springs range is used thus allows neap tides to deliver roughly twice as much power as they would offer without pumping. So a system with pumping would show two-weekly variations in power of just a factor of 2 instead of 4. </p><h3>Getting &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; tidal power by using two basins</h3><p class="first">Here&rsquo;s a neat idea: have two basins, one of which is the &ldquo;full&rdquo; basin and one the &ldquo;empty&rdquo; basin; every high tide, the full basin is topped up; every low tide, the empty basin is emptied. These toppings-up and emptyings could be done either passively through sluices, or actively by pumps (using the trick mentioned above). Whenever power is required, water is allowed to flow from the full basin to the empty basin, or (better in power terms) between one of the basins and the sea. The capital cost of a two-basin scheme may be bigger because of the need for extra walls; the big win is that power is available all the time, so the facility can follow demand. </p><p>We can use power generated from the empty basin to pump extra water into the full basin at high tide, and similarly use power from the full basin to pump down the empty basin at low tide. This self-pumping would boost the total power delivered by the facility without ever needing to buy energy from the grid. It&rsquo;s a delightful feature of a two-pool solution that the optimal time to <em>pump</em> water into the high pool is high tide, which is also the optimal time to <em>generate</em> power from the low pool. Similarly, low tide is the perfect time to pump down the low pool, and it&rsquo;s the perfect time to generate power from the high pool. In a simple simulation, I&rsquo;ve found that a two-lagoon system in a location with a natural tidal range of 4 m can, with an appropriate pumping schedule, deliver a <em>steady</em> power of 4.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> (MacKay, 2007a). One lagoon&rsquo;s water level is always kept above mean sea-level; the other lagoon&rsquo;s level is always kept below mean sealevel. This power density of 4.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> is 50% bigger than the maximum possible average power density of an ordinary tide-pool in the same lo- </p><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Table G.11.</span> Power density offered by the pumping trick, assuming the boost height is constrained to be the same as the tidal amplitude.

Two lagoons are located at sea-level. (a) One simple way of using two lagoons is to label one the high pool and the other the low pool; when the surrounding sea level is near to high tide, let water into the high pool, or actively pump it in (using electricity from other sources); and similarly, when the sea level is near to low tide, empty the low pool, either passively or by active pumping; then whenever power is sufficiently valuable, generate power on demand by letting water from the high pool to the low pool. (b) Another arrangement that might deliver more power per unit area has no flow of water between the two lagoons. While one lagoon is being pumped full or pumped empty, the other lagoon can deliver steady, demand-following power to the grid.

They concluded that the embodied carbon in im- ports to Britain (which should arguably be added to Britain&rsquo;s official car- bon footprint of 11 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person) is roughly 16 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person. A subsequent, more detailed study commissioned by DEFRA estimated that the embodied carbon in imports is smaller, but still very significant: about 6.2 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year per person. In energy terms, 6 tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year is something like 60 kWh/d. </p><p>Here, let&rsquo;s see if we can reproduce these conclusions in a different way, using the weights of the imports. </p><p>Figure H.2 shows Britain&rsquo;s imports in the year 2006 in three ways: on the left, the total <em>value</em> of the imports is broken down by the country of origin. In the middle, the same total financial value is broken down by the type of stuff imported, using the categories of HM Revenue and Customs. On the right, all maritime imports to Britain are shown by <em>weight</em> and bro- ken down by the categories used by the Department for Transport, which doesn&rsquo;t care whether something is leather or tobacco &ndash; it keeps track of how heavy stuff is, whether it is dry or liquid, and whether the stuff arrived in a container or a lorry. </p><p>The energy cost of the imported fuels (top right) <em>is</em> included in the standard accounts of British energy consumption; the energy costs of all the other imports are not. For most materials, the embodied energy per unit weight is greater than or equal to 10 kWh per kg &ndash; the same as the energy per unit weight of fossil fuels. This is true of all metals and alloys, all polymers and composites, most paper products, and many ceramics, for example. The exceptions are raw materials like ores; porous ceramics such as concrete, brick, and porcelain, whose energy cost is 10 times lower; wood and some rubbers; and glasses, whose energy cost is a whisker lower than 10 kWh per kg. [<span class="tinylink">r22oz</span>] </p><p>We can thus roughly estimate the energy footprint of our imports sim- ply from the weight of their manufactured materials, if we exclude things like ores and wood. Given the crudity of the data with which we are work- ing, we will surely slip up and inadvertently include some things made of wood and glass, but hopefully such slips will be balanced by our underes- timation of the energy content of most of the metals and plastics and more complex goods, many of which have an embodied energy of not 10 but 30 kWh per kg, or even more. </p><p>For this calculation I&rsquo;ll take from the right-hand column in figure H.2 </p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure306.png" width="219" height="166" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure H.1.</span> Continuous casting of steel strands at Korea Iron and Steel Company.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><img src="figure305.png" width="448" height="840" alt=""><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure H.2.</span> Imports of stuff to the UK,2006.</div></div></div> <div id="book_sidebar"><div class="pos" id="rm"></div></div><div id="textcol"><p class="first">the iron and steel products, the dry bulk products, the containerized freight and the &ldquo;other freight,&rdquo; which total 98million tons per year.

This includes the energy used in transporting the raw materials to the factory but not energy used to transport the final product to the building site. </p><p>Table H.6 uses these numbers to estimate the process energy formaking a three-bedroom house. The <em>gross energy requirement</em> widens the bound- ary, including the embodied energy of urban infrastructure, for example, the embodied energy of the machinery that makes the raw materials. A rough rule of thumb to get the gross energy requirement of a building is to double the process energy requirement [<span class="tinylink">3kmcks</span>]. </p><p>If we share 42 000 kWh over 100 years, and double it to estimate the gross energy cost, the total embodied energy of a house comes to about 2.3 kWh/d. This is the energy cost of the <em>shell</em> of the house only &ndash; the bricks, tiles, roof beams. </p><div class="imgcap" style="top:18em"><img src="figure307.png" width="221" height="168" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure H.3.</span> Niobium open cast mine, Brazil.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><table class="framed" id="p325" summary=""><tr class="top"><td>Material</td><td colspan="2">Embodied energy</td></tr><tr class="thinbottom"><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(MJ/kg)</td><td>(kWh/kg)</td></tr><tr><td>kiln-dried sawn softwood</td><td>3.4</td><td>0.94</td></tr><tr><td>kiln-dried sawn hardwood</td><td>2.0</td><td>0.56</td></tr><tr><td>air dried sawn hardwood</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.14</td></tr><tr><td>hardboard</td><td>24.2</td><td>6.7</td></tr><tr><td>particleboard</td><td>8.0</td><td>2.2</td></tr><tr><td>MDF</td><td>11.3</td><td>3.1</td></tr><tr><td>plywood</td><td>10.4</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>glue-laminated timber</td><td>11</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>laminated veneer lumber</td><td>11</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr class="thinbottom"><td>straw</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.07</td></tr><tr><td>stabilised earth</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td>imported dimension granite</td><td>13.9</td><td>3.9</td></tr><tr><td>local dimension granite</td><td>5.9</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>gypsum plaster</td><td>2.9</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>plasterboard</td><td>4.4</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>fibre cement</td><td>4.8</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>cement</td><td>5.6</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>in situ concrete</td><td>1.9</td><td>0.53</td></tr><tr><td>precast steam-cured concrete</td><td>2.0</td><td>0.56</td></tr><tr><td>precast tilt-up concrete</td><td>1.9</td><td>0.53</td></tr><tr><td>clay bricks</td><td>2.5</td><td>0.69</td></tr><tr><td>concrete blocks</td><td>1.5</td><td>0.42</td></tr><tr class="thinbottom"><td>autoclaved aerated concrete</td><td>3.6</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>plastics &ndash; general</td><td>90</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>PVC</td><td>80</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>synthetic rubber</td><td>110</td><td>30</td></tr><tr class="thinbottom"><td>acrylic paint</td><td>61.5</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>glass</td><td>12.7</td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td>fibreglass (glasswool)</td><td>28</td><td>7.8</td></tr><tr><td>aluminium</td><td>170</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>copper</td><td>100</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>galvanised steel</td><td>38</td><td>10.6</td></tr><tr class="bottom"><td>stainless steel</td><td>51.5</td><td>14.3</td></tr></table><div class="imgcap"><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Table H.4.</span> Embodied energy of building materials (assuming virgin rather than recycled product is used).

A trillion is 10<sup>12</sup>. The standard prefix meaning &ldquo;billion&rdquo; (10<sup>9</sup>) is &ldquo;giga.&rdquo; </p><p>In continental Europe, the abbreviations Mio and Mrd denote a million and billion respectively. Mrd is short for milliard, which means 10<sup>9</sup>. </p><p>The abbreviation m is often used to mean million, but this abbreviation is incompatible with the SI &ndash; think of mg (milligram) for example. So I don&rsquo;t use m to mean million. Where some people use m, I replace it by M. For example, I use Mtoe for million tons of oil equivalent, and MtCO<sub>2</sub> for million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. </p><h2>Annoying units</h2><p class="first">There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of commonly used units that are annoying for various reasons. I&rsquo;ve figured out what some of them mean. I list them here, to help you translate the media stories you read. </p><h4>Homes</h4><p class="first">The &ldquo;home&rdquo; is commonly used when describing the power of renewable facilities. For example, &ldquo;The &pound;300 million Whitelee wind farm&rsquo;s 140 turbines will generate 322 MW &ndash; enough to power 200 000 homes.&rdquo; The &ldquo;home&rdquo; is defined by the BritishWind Energy Association to be a power of <span class="red">4700 kWh per year</span> [<span class="websitetitle">www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp</span>]. That&rsquo;s 0.54 kW, or <span class="red">13 kWh per day</span>. (A few other organizations use 4000 kWh/y per household.) </p><p>The &ldquo;home&rdquo; annoys me because I worry that people confuse it with <em>the total power consumption of the occupants of a home</em> &ndash; but the latter is actually </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p class="first">about 24 times bigger. The &ldquo;home&rdquo; covers the average domestic <em>electricity</em> consumption of a household, only. Not the household&rsquo;s home heating. Nor their workplace. Nor their transport. Nor all the energy-consuming things that society does for them. </p><p>Incidentally, when they talk of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of a &ldquo;home,&rdquo; the official exchange rate appears to be 4 tons CO<sub>2</sub> per home per year. </p><h4>Power stations</h4><p class="first">Energy saving ideas are sometimes described in terms of power stations. For example according to a BBC report on putting new everlasting LED lightbulbs in traffic lights, &ldquo;The power savings would be huge &ndash; keeping the UK&rsquo;s traffic lights running requires the equivalent of two medium- sized power stations.&rdquo; <span class="websitetitle">news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/sci/tech/specials/ sheffield_99/449368.stm</span> </p><p>What is a medium-sized power station? 10 MW? 50 MW? 100 MW? 500 MW? I don&rsquo;t have a clue. A google search indicates that some people think it&rsquo;s 30 MW, some 250 MW, some 500 MW (the most common choice), and some 800 MW. What a useless unit! </p><p>Surely it would be clearer for the article about traffic lights to express what it&rsquo;s saying as a percentage? &ldquo;Keeping the UK&rsquo;s traffic lights running requires 11 MW of electricity, which is 0.03% of the UK&rsquo;s electricity.&rdquo; This would reveal how &ldquo;huge&rdquo; the power savings are. </p><p>Figure I.2 shows the powers of the UK&rsquo;s 19 coal power stations. </p><h4>Cars taken off the road</h4><p class="first">Some advertisements describe reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> pollution in terms of the &ldquo;equivalent number of cars taken off the road.&rdquo; For example, Richard Branson says that if Virgin Trains&rsquo; Voyager fleet switched to 20% biodiesel &ndash; incidentally, don&rsquo;t you feel it&rsquo;s outrageous to call a train a &ldquo;green biodiesel- powered train&rdquo; when it runs on 80% fossil fuels and just 20% biodiesel? &ndash; sorry, I got distracted. Richard Branson says that <em>if</em> Virgin Trains&rsquo; Voyager fleet switched to 20% biodiesel &ndash; I emphasize the &ldquo;if&rdquo; because people like Beardie are always getting media publicity for announcing that they are <em>thinking</em> of doing good things, but some of these fanfared initiatives are later quietly cancelled, such as the idea of towing aircraft around airports to make them greener &ndash; sorry, I got distracted again. Richard Branson says that <em>if</em> Virgin Trains&rsquo; Voyager fleet switched to 20% biodiesel, then there would be a reduction of 34 500 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, which is equivalent to &ldquo;23 000 cars taken off the road.&rdquo; This statement reveals the exchange rate: </p><p style="margin:0em 0 0em 2em">&ldquo;one car taken off the road&rdquo; &harr; - 1.5 tons per year of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><h4>Calories</h4><p class="first">The calorie is annoying because the diet community call a kilocalorie a Calorie. 1 such food Calorie = 1000 calories. </p><p>2500 kcal = 3 kWh = 10 000 kJ = 10 MJ.</p><div class="imgcap"><img src="figure309-0-0.png" width="215" height="309" alt=""><div class="sidebarcaption"><span class="figurenumber">Figure I.2.</span> Powers of Britain&rsquo;s coal power stations. I&rsquo;ve highlighted in blue 8 GW of generating capacity that will close by 2015. 2500&nbsp;MW, shared across Britain, is the same as 1&nbsp;kWh per day per person.</div></div></div>			     <div id="textcol"><h4>Barrels</h4><p class="first">An annoying unit loved by the oil community, along with the ton of oil. Why can&rsquo;t they stick to one unit? A barrel of oil is 6.1 GJ or 1700 kWh. </p><p>Barrels are doubly annoying because there are multiple definitions of barrels, all having different volumes. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about barrels of oil. One barrel is 42 U.S. gallons, or 159 litres. One barrel of oil is 0.1364 tons of oil. One barrel of crude oil has an energy of 5.75 GJ. One barrel of oil weighs 136 kg. One ton of crude oil is 7.33 barrels and 42.1 GJ. The carbon-pollution rate of crude oil is 400 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per barrel. <span class="websitetitle">www.chemlink.com.au/convers- ions.htm</span>. This means that when the price of oil is $100 per barrel, oil energy costs 6&cent; per kWh. If there were a carbon tax of $250 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> on fossil fuels, that tax would increase the price of a barrel of oil by $100. </p><h4>Gallons</h4><p class="first">The gallon would be a fine human-friendly unit, except the Yanks messed it up by defining the gallon differently from everyone else, as they did the pint and the quart. The US volumes are all roughly five-sixths of the correct volumes. </p><p>1 US gal = 3.785 l = 0.83 imperial gal. 1 imperial gal = 4.545 l.</p><h4>Tons</h4><p class="first">Tons are annoying because there are short tons, long tons and metric tons. They are close enough that I don&rsquo;t bother distinguishing between them. 1 short ton (2000 lb) = 907 kg; 1 long ton (2240 lb) = 1016 kg; 1 metric ton (or tonne) = 1000 kg. </p><h4>BTU and quads</h4><p class="first">British thermal units are annoying because they are neither part of the <em>Syst&egrave;me Internationale</em>, nor are they of a useful size. Like the useless joule, they are too small, so you have to roll out silly prefixes like &ldquo;quadrillion&rdquo; (10<sup>15</sup>) to make practical use of them. </p><p>1 kJ is 0.947 BTU. 1 kWh is 3409 BTU.</p><p>A &ldquo;quad&rdquo; is 1 quadrillion BTU = 293 TWh.</p><h2>Funny units</h2><h4>Cups of tea</h4><p class="first">Is this a way to make solar panels sound good? &ldquo;Once all the 7 000 pho- tovoltaic panels are in place, it is expected that the solar panels will create 180 000 units of renewable electricity each year &ndash; enough energy to make nine million cups of tea.&rdquo; This announcement thus equates 1 kWh to 50 cups of tea. </p></div>			     <div id="textcol"><p>As a unit of volume, 1 US cup (half a US pint) is officially 0.24 l; but a cup of tea or coffee is usually about 0.18 l. To raise 50 cups of water, at 0.18 l per cup, from 15 &deg;C to 100 &deg;C requires 1 kWh. </p><p>So &ldquo;nine million cups of tea per year&rdquo; is another way of saying &ldquo;20 kW.&rdquo;</p><h4>Double-decker buses, Albert Halls and Wembley stadiums</h4><p class="first">&ldquo;If everyone in the UK that could, installed cavity wall insulation, we could cut carbon dioxide emissions by a huge 7 million tons. That&rsquo;s enough carbon dioxide to fill nearly 40 million double-decker buses or fill the new Wembley stadium 900 times!&rdquo; </p><p>From which we learn the helpful fact that one Wembley is 44 000 double decker buses. Actually, Wembley&rsquo;s bowl has a volume of 1 140 000 m<sup>3</sup>. </p><p>&ldquo;If every household installed just one energy saving light bulb, there would be enough carbon dioxide saved to fill the Royal Albert Hall 1,980 times!&rdquo; (An Albert Hall is 100 000 m<sup>3</sup>.) </p><p>Expressing amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> by volume rather than mass is a great way to make them sound big. Should &ldquo;1 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per day&rdquo; sound too small, just say &ldquo;200 000 litres of CO<sub>2</sub> per year&rdquo;! </p><h2>More volumes</h2><p class="first">A container is 2.4 m wide by 2.6 m high by (6.1 or 12.2) metres long (for the TEU and FEU respectively). </p><p>One TEU is the size of a small 20-foot container &ndash; an interior volume of about 33 m<sup>3</sup>. Most containers you see today are 40-foot containers with a size of 2 TEU. A 40-foot container weighs 4 tons and can carry 26 tons of stuff; its volume is 67.5 m<sup>3</sup>. </p><p>A swimming pool has a volume of about 3000 m<sup>3</sup>. </p><p>One double decker bus has a volume of 100 m<sup>3</sup>. </p><p>One hot air balloon is 2500 m<sup>3</sup>. </p><p>The great pyramid at Giza has a volume of 2 500 000 cubic metres. </p><h2>Areas</h2><p class="first">The area of the earth&rsquo;s surface is 500 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>; the land area is 150 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>. </p><p>My typical British 3-bedroom house has a floor area of 88 m<sup>2</sup>. In the USA, the average size of a single-family house is 2330 square feet (216 m<sup>2</sup>). </p><h2>Powers</h2><p class="first">If we add the suffix &ldquo;e&rdquo; to a power, this means that we&rsquo;re explicitly talking about electrical power.
